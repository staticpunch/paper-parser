A group of C-end degrons that are recognized by specific cullin-RING ubiquitin E3 ligases (CRLs) has recently been identified in some of these abnormal polypeptides. Here, we report three crystal structures of a CRL2 substrate receptor, KLHDC2, in complex with the diglycine-ending C-end degrons of two earlyterminated selenoproteins and the N-terminal proteolytic fragment of USP1. The E3 recognizes the degron peptides in a similarly coiled conformation and cradles their C-terminal diglycine with a deep surface pocket. By hydrogen bonding with multiple backbone carbonyls of the peptides, KLHDC2 further locks in the otherwise degenerate degrons with a compact interface and unexpected high affinities. Our results reveal the structural mechanism by which KLHDC2 recognizes the simplest C-end degron and suggest a functional necessity of the E3 to tightly maintain the low abundance of its select substrates.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nThe ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) removes aberrant proteins and regulates diverse cellular functions by promoting the turnover of numerous protein substrates (Goldberg, 2003; Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998). The high capacity and selectivity of UPS is conferred by a plethora of ubiquitin E3 ligases, which number in the hundreds for humans (Zheng and Shabek, 2017). Acting at the final step of a three-enzyme cascade, many ubiquitin E3 ligases recognize their cognate substrates through a short linear sequence motif known as a degron (Guharoy et al., 2016; Lucas and Ciulli, 2017; Me \u00b4 sza \u00b4 ros et al., 2017). To achieve high specificity, eukaryotic cells have evolved a variety of mechanisms governing degron-E3 interactions. For many degrons, proper forms of post-translational modifications, such as serine or threonine phosphorylation and proline hydroxylation, have been shown to play a key role in enabling E3 binding (Hao et al., 2005, 2007; Min et al., 2002; Orlicky et al., 2003; Wuet al., 2003). On the other hand, an increasing number of degrons have also been identified to function in a modificationindependent manner (da Fonseca et al., 2011; Kraft et al., 2005; Padmanabhan et al., 2006; Uljon et al., 2016; Zhuang et al., 2009).\n\nIn the classical N-end rule pathway, both aforementioned degrons have been discovered at the extreme N terminus of proteins (Tasaki et al., 2012; Varshavsky, 2011). Some of these N-degrons are generated by proteolytic cleavage, whereas others are created by N-terminal modifications. While certain resulting N-terminal amino acids can stabilize a protein, other ones, such as arginine, have been shown to substantially reduce the half-life of a substrate. Previous studies have identified a family of UBR-box-containing proteins, classified as N-recognins, responsible for recognizing the N-terminal degrons (Tasaki et al., 2005, 2009; Xia et al., 2008). The crystal structure of the UBR-box domain from yeast UBR1 has been determined in complex with the N-degron peptide of the cohesion subunit Scc1 (Choi et al., 2010). In this structure, the E3 recognizes the N-end degron of the proteolytically generated Scc1 C-terminal fragment through its free backbone amino group, the side chain of the leading arginine, and the penultimate residue. A similar recognition interface has also been revealed for the mammalian UBR1ortholog (Matta-Camacho et al., 2010). By recognizing the N-end degrons exposed by endopeptidase cleavage, the N-end rule not only dictates the half-life of full-length proteins but also participates in protein quality control by eliminating proteolytic products.\n\nLike the C-terminal polypeptide fragments generated by proteolysis, the N-terminal segments and early-terminated protein products could also impose a threat to the normal functions of the cell. Recent studies have unraveled a cohort of ubiquitin ligases from the cullin-RING superfamily, which are implicated in the recognition of specific sequence elements embedded in the extreme C terminus of these truncated polypeptides (Koren et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2018). This novel protein-degradation mechanism, named DesCEND (destruction via C-end degron), relies on select amino acids at key positions within the degrons, which are usually less than ten residues long. Interestingly, one of these C-end degrons is characterized by a strikingly simple diglycine motif at the extreme C terminus. With a highly degenerate N-terminal region, this diglycine-containing sequence is thought to be recognized by a ElonginB-ElonginC (BC)-box protein, KLHDC2, which functions as a substrate receptor of the CRL2 E3 complex. Remarkably, the diglycine C-end degron has been found in multiple classes of DesCEND substrates, including early-terminated selenoproteins (SelK and SelS), the N-terminal proteolytic product of a deubiquitinating enzyme (USP1), and a number of full-length proteins (Koren et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2018). Klhdc2 homozygous knockout mice display an embryonic lethal phenotype (Dickinson et al., 2016). KLHDC2hasthusemergedasanessentialE3 ligase with a multifaceted role in protein homeostasis.\n\nSimilar to other known degrons, the C-end degrons are selfsufficient and can induce proteasomal degradation when fused to otherwise stable proteins. To reveal the mechanism by which a prototypical C-terminal degron is decoded in the DesCEND pathway, we determined the crystal structures of KLHDC2 in complex with three different diglycine C-degron peptides and performed detailed analyses of the interaction interface. Our studies have not only mapped the essential elements dictating the specific interactions between the C-end degron and its cognate E3 but also provided a detailed quantitative understanding of the system and shed light on a unique role of DesCEND that is distinct from the N-end rule pathway.\n",

        "## Mapping Key Elements in the SelK C-End Degron\n\nThe selenoprotein SelK contains a selenocysteine (Sec), which is encoded by the stop codon UGA (Ambrogelly et al., 2007). With help from a Sec insertion sequence element in the 3 0 UTR, this terminal signal in the SelK mRNA is translated into Sec, allowing the production of the full-length protein (Driscoll and Copeland, 2003). When selenium is scarce, the lack of Sec-transfer RNA causes premature termination of translation. Recent studies have shown that the resulting early-terminated SelK protein bears a C-terminal diglycine degron, which triggers its CRL2 KLHDC2 -mediated proteasomal degradation (Lin et al., 2015). The BC-box protein KLHDC2 contains a C-terminal region responsible for CUL2-elongin-B-C binding and an N-terminal kelch repeat b -propeller domain, which is commonly used by cullin-RING ubiquitin E3 ligase (CRL) substrate receptor subunits to engage substrates (Duda et al., 2011; Mahrour et al., 2008; Zimmerman et al., 2010). To formally establish the direct interaction between SelK C-end degron and KLHDC2, we purified the recombinant KLHDC2 kelch domain (hereafter referred to as KLHDC2) and performed glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown assays using GST-fused SelK C-end degron that are 8 or 12 amino acids long. KLHDC2 displayed robust interaction with both degron peptides, but not GST alone (Figure 1A). This result indicates that the BC-box protein can directly recognize the SelK C-end degron and that the kelch repeat domain of KLHDC2 is sufficient for this interaction.\n\nTo map the minimal length of the SelK C-end degron for high-affinity binding to KLHDC2, we established the degron peptide-E3 interaction in an Amplified Luminescence Proximity Homogeneous Assay (AlphaScreen) with a biotinylated 12- amino acid SelK degron peptide and GST-fused KLHDC2 immobilized on the donor and acceptor beads, respectively (Figure S1A). We then carried out competition experiments with label-free SelK degron peptides of varying lengths ranging from 12 to 2 amino acids. These peptides share the critical extreme C-terminal diglycine motif with variably shortened N-terminal ends. By titrating the concentration of the competing peptides, we were able to derive dose response curves and obtain the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for each peptide. Due to the extremely low concentration of the immobilized components, the IC50 value determined from our competition assay can be approximated to KD. To our amazement, the 12-amino acid SelK degron peptide abolished the AlphaScreen signal with an IC50 of /C24 3 nM (Figure 1B). Decreasing the length of the degron peptide from 12 amino acid to 5 amino acid caused a gradual and slight decrease in affinity. The 5-residue degron nevertheless retained an affinity toward the E3 ligase in the low-nanomolar range. We observed a dramatic 30-fold increase in KD when the peptide length was reduced to 4 amino acids, indicating the loss of a critical contact between the degron and the E3. Interestingly, even diglycine was able to bind KLHDC2 and compete with the biotinylated 12amino acid degron that is immobilized on the AlphaScreen donor beads (Figure 1B). The extreme C-terminal diglycine motif, therefore, contributes a substantial amount of binding energy to the degron-E3 interaction. Together, these results revealed a strong correlation between the length of the SelK degron peptide and its strength in binding KLHDC2 and established the minimal degron length of 5 amino acids for a high-affinity interaction. The remarkably tight binding between the 12-amino-acid SelK degron and KLHDC2 was further confirmed by the dissociation constant of their direct interaction measured with Octet biolayer interferometry, which yielded a KD value of /C24 4 nM (Figure 1C).\n\nThe full-length SelK protein contains three additional amino acids beyond the diglycine motif, which allows the polypeptide to evade DesCEND. Recent studies have revealed a requirement for the diglycine motif to terminate a polypeptide in order to give rise to a functional C-end degron (Lin et al., 2015). We hypothesized that the free extreme C-terminal backbone carboxyl group, along with the tandem glycine residues, must play a role in E3 binding. Using our AlphaScreen-based competition assay, we compared the affinity of the 8-amino acid SelK degron peptide that was C-terminally amidated to that of the unmodified peptide. Consistent with our hypothesis, this simple modification of the C-terminal carboxyl group profoundly decreased the affinity of the degron peptide by nearly a 1,000-fold (Figure 1D). Using an 8-amino acid peptide with the last glycine residue mutated to leucine, we further characterized and validated the importance of the diglycine residues, which has been previously established in cell-based assays (Lin et al., 2018). In contrast to the singledigit nanomolar (nM) affinity of the wild-type SelK degron peptide, the glycine-to-leucine mutation increased the IC50 value to /C24 100 m M(Figure 1D).",
        "## Crystal Structure of KLHDC2 Bound to the SelK Degron Peptide\n\nIn agreement with the high-affinity binding determined from the AlphaScreen assay, KLHDC2 forms a stable complex with the\n\nSelK degron peptide as detected by native protein mass spectrometry (Figure S1B). We crystallized and determined the structure of the KLHDC2 kelch repeat domain in complex with the 8-amino acid SelK C-end degron peptide (Table 1). Akin to most kelch repeats, KLHDC2 adopts a six-bladed b -propeller fold with each blade composed of four antiparallel b strands (named A to D from inner to outer position) (Figure 2A). Conventionally, the side of a b -propeller fold constructed by the loops linking strands A and D and strands B and C is referred to as the ''top'' surface (Sprague et al., 2000). These loops are highly variable between different b -propeller proteins and are frequently involved in protein interaction or enzymatic catalysis. In KLHDC2, these loops form a deep binding pocket, which is responsible for recognizing the C-end degron.\n\nKLHDC2 is evolutionarily conserved from amoeba to humans (Figure S2). Surface conservation mapping of its kelch repeat domain reveals a group of solvent-exposed and highly conserved residues clustered at the bottom and one side of the top surface pocket. This special feature of the binding pocket highlights its functional importance (Figure 2B). The KLHDC2\n\npocket is /C24 16 A \u02da long and /C24 12 A \u02da wide. It can be divided into two chambers, which are separated by a low ridge in the middle. Interestingly, one chamber is more conserved than the other. Moreover, electrostatic potential mapping of KLHDC2 unveils a basic patch at the bottom of the pocket, which is co-localized with the highly conserved surface area (Figure 2C).\n\nThe SelK C-end degron peptide is anchored to the KLHDC2 top surface pocket in a highly coiled conformation. Its C-terminal end is deeply embedded in the more conserved pocket chamber, hereafter referred to as ''chamber C.'' By contrast, the N-terminal end of the degron peptide is accommodated by ''chamber N'' and more exposed to solvent (Figures 2B and S3A). The complex structure unmasks an intimate and compact interface between the E3 ligase and the degron peptide, which is dominated by inter-molecular hydrogen bond networks and salt bridges. The extreme C-terminal carboxyl group simultaneously forms two hydrogen bonds and two salt bridges with three highly conserved KLHDC2 residues (Arg236, Arg241, and Ser269), which demarcate one side of chamber C (Figures 2B, 2D, and 2E). The tandem glycine resides are buttressed by two KLHDC2\n\nalanine residues (Ala219 and Ala220) from the bottom and flanked by three KLHDC2 aromatic residues (Tyr163, Trp191, and Trp270) on the sides. The backbone carbonyl group of the penultimate glycine residue is further locked in through a hydrogen bond donated by the side chain of KLHDC2 Trp191 (Figures 2D and 2E). Overall, the strict requirement of a glycine residue at the penultimate position can be explained by two factors. First, the backbone dihedral angles ( 4 y 90 /C14 , c y /C0 5 /C14 ) are limited to glycine. Second, the space between the C a atom and the surrounding KLHDC2 residues can only accommodate a residue without a side chain. Although glycine is strongly preferred at the last position of the diglycine degron, alanine is also allowed based on previous findings (Lin et al., 2018). The backbone geometry of the terminating residue is less constrained than internal amino acids, but the limited space between its C a atom and the surrounding KLHDC2 residues would only accommodate a small side chain.\n\nBeyond the C-terminal diglycine motif, the SelK degron makes three additional hydrogen bonds with the E3 ligase, all through its backbone carbonyls. Pointing up from the bottom ridge of the degron-binding pocket, Lys147 of KLHDC2 stabilizes the SelK peptide by hydrogen bonding with the backbone carbonyl groups at the /C0 3 and /C0 5 positions (Figures 2D and 2E). Arg189 of the E3, meanwhile, holds the N-terminal end of the SelK degron in place by interacting with the /C0 6 carbonyl. This hydrogen bond network is further substantiated by four stably bound water molecules, which either bridge the degron and the E3 or stabilize the conformation of the peptide itself. In contrast to these extensive polar interactions, the side chains of the SelK degron peptide only make limited van der Waals packing against KLHDC2. Out of the seven degron residues observed in our structure, only two at /C0 4 and /C0 5 positions use their side chains to make contacts with the boundary of chamber N(SelK-M88 with Y50, L342, and L343 in KLHDC2 and SelK-P87 with Y62, H109, and W321 in KLHDC2). Collectively, the KLHDC2-SelK degron interface is predominantly mediated by backbone groups on the degron side and the side chains of amino acids lining the E3 pocket. The physical size of the E3 pocket, which can only accommodate 7 amino acids from the degron, limits the impact of a longer degron sequence on binding affinity. Meanwhile, the close and continuous contacts the pocket makes with the C-terminal 5 amino acids of the degron explain its minimum length requirement for high-affinity interactions.",
        "## Mutational Analysis of the KLHDC2-Degron-Binding Pocket\n\nTo dissect the functional roles of the degron-binding residues in KLHDC2, we engineered a series of single amino acid mutants andtested their activities both in vitro and in vivo . We first purified individual KLHDC2 mutants and assessed their ability to bind GST-fused SelK degron in a pull-down assay (Figures 3A and S3B). In parallel, we generated a Global Protein Stability (GPS) reporter cell line expressing GFP-fused SelK C-end degron with endogenous KLHDC2 knocked down by small hairpin RNA (shRNA). We then individually introduced wild-type KLHDC2 or its single point mutants and compared their abilities to promote the degradation of SelK degron (Figures 3B and S3C). In this cell-based system, degradation of the GFP-fused substrate protein can be visualized by a lower steady-state abundance of GFP-substrate to RFP among the entire cell population (peak shift from right to left).\n\nAmong the three KLHDC2 residues directly interacting with the C-terminal carboxyl group, alanine mutation of Arg241, but not the other two amino acids (Arg236 and Ser269), abrogated the binding of the SelK degron and failed to induce the degradation of the substrate (Figures 3A and 3C). These results accentuate the importance of the C-terminal carboxyl group in the SelK degron and indicate a central role of Arg241. This strictly conserved and positively charged residue makes a bidentate interaction with the peptide-terminating group via a salt bridge and a hydrogen bond. Intriguingly, when Arg241 is mutated to lysine, KLHDC2 retained its ability to bind and destabilize SelK, highlighting the ''hotspot'' nature of the inter-molecular salt bridge. In support of this notion, removal or reversal of the positive charge at this position (R241L and R241E), or neutralization of its positive charge by mutating the nearby R236 residue to a glutamate (R236E), prevented KLHDC2 from binding and degrading the substrate. Noticeably, altering Ser269, which\n\nDuetotheirpotentialrolesin stabilizing the kelch repeat fold, we chose not to mutate the three aromatic residues sandwiching the diglycine motif. Although the two nearby alanine residues, A219 and A220, at the bottom of the KLHDC2 pocket are solvent exposed and become buried by the tandem glycine residues in the complex, mutating either one to leucine altered the solution behavior of KLHDC2, as detected by size exclusion chromatography (data not shown). The integrity of this portion of the pocket, therefore, is important to the proper folding of the b -propeller.\n\nMoving to the middle of the pocket, we next mutated the ridge residue, Lys147, which donates hydrogen bonds to the /C0 3 and /C0 5 backbone carbonyl groups. The KLHDC2 K147A mutant has a severely impaired degron-binding activity and loses its function in downregulating SelK. These data echo the importance of the /C0 5 amino acid of the SelK degron in maintaining high-affinity binding, as observed in our AlphaScreen competition assay. In chamber N of the KLHDC2 pocket, Arg189 makes the only direct hydrogen bond interaction with the degron backbone at the /C0 6 position. Mutating this positively charged residue to alanine had little to no effect on degron binding and SelK stability, in accordance with the subtle change in IC50 whenthedegronpeptide length is reduced from 6 amino acids to 5 amino acids. As anticipated, degron bind- ing determined by our in vitro pull-down experiments is strongly correlated with protein stability measured by the cell-based GPS assay.",
        "## Diglycine C-End Degrons from Other Substrates\n\nIn addition to SelK, the extreme C-terminal diglycine degron has been found in a number of proteins in their full-length, earlyterminated, or proteolytically processed form (Koren et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2018). These degrons do not share any consensus sequence except the C-terminal diglycine motif. To understand how degenerate N-terminal sequences impact KLHDC2 binding and are accommodated by the E3, we chose to focus on the diglycine degrons from two additional proteins,\n\nSelS and USP1-NTD, which have been previously suggested to be KLHDC2 substrates. In our AlphaScreen-based competition assay, the 8-amino acid SelS degron peptide displayed an IC50 value slightly above SelK, whereas the potency of the USP1NTD degron peptide is /C24 7-fold lower (Figure 4A). The N-terminal sequences of USP1 and SelS degron peptides are distinct from SelK, with the exception of a single proline residue at the /C0 5 position in SelS. Some variation in this portion of the degron, therefore, can have detectable, albeit minor, effects on the degron-KLHDC2 interaction.\n\nTo compare the binding modes of the two degrons to SelK, we determined their crystal structures in complex with KLHDC2. The 8-amino-acid SelS and USP1 degron peptides dock to the KLHDC2 top surface pocket in a topology nearly identical to SelK. The superposition of the three structures reveals a perfectly aligned C-terminal diglycine motif and a small degree of variation between the backbone atoms of the N-terminal residues (Figure 4B). From the distal end of chamber C to the opposite end in chamber N, the KLHDC2 pocket widens, thus harboring side chains of different sizes decorating the N-terminal end of the three degrons. For instance, at the /C0 3 position of the degron, the side chain can extend from a single methyl group to an isobutyl group, while at the /C0 4 position, the KLHDC2 pocket is able to house a degron residue ranging from a serine to a methionine. Among the three degron peptides, SelK has the highest affinity toward KLHDC2 and displays a clear electron density for its residue at the /C0 7 position. These properties could be attributed to the rigidity provided by the three sequential prolines at its N-terminal end. By contrast, USP1 features a glycine at the /C0 5 position, which could destabilize the conformation of the degron and contribute to its weaker binding.\n\nWe next subjected the C-end degron of USP1-NTD to the GPS-based stability assay in conjunction with the series of KLHDC2 mutants previously described. As expected, the majority of the KLHDC2 mutations located in the degron-binding pocket, such as R241A, K147A, and R189A, elicited the same effects on USP1-NTD degron stability, as they did to SelK (Figure 3C). To our surprise, though, two KLHDC2 mutants yielded opposite results for the two substrates. While the KLHDC2 R241K mutant maintained its wild-type ability to destabilize SelK, the same mutant failed to promote the degradation of USP1-NTD. This differential effect was also observed for the KLHDC2 R236A mutant. Overall, the USP1-KLHDC2 interface, particularly at the position where the C-terminal carboxyl group of the degron is recognized, seems to be less tolerant to perturbation.",
        "## Affinity Requirement for Substrate Degradation\n\nThe opposite effects of the KLHDC2 arginine mutations on the stability of SelK and USP1 degrons is in stark contrast to the structural similarity of their E3-bound forms. Why would the KLHDC2 R241K mutant degrade one substrate but spare the other? Multiple factors, such as E3 binding, the nature of E2, and the availability of ubiquitin-conjugating sites, could influence the efficiency of substrate ubiquitination. In our case, most of these factors are constant and can be ruled out. Moreover, USP1 can be destabilized by the wild-type E3, and the KLHDC2 R241K mutant is able to degrade SelK. The defective degradation of USP1 by the mutated E3, therefore, is not due to loss of function in either the degron or the KLHDC2 mutant. We postulated that the answer to the question above lies in the altered affinity of the two substrates toward the kelch repeat mutant and their cellular concentrations, which dictate their complex formation.\n\nTo test our hypothesis, we first sought to quantify the binding of the substrate degrons to the KLHDC2 R241K mutant. In the crystal structures of wild-type KLHDC2 bound to SelK and USP1 degron peptides, Arg241 interacts with the extreme C terminus of both peptides via a salt bridge and a hydrogen bond. The R241K mutation is predicted to weaken the binding by losing the hydrogen bond while retaining the salt bridge. We replaced wild-type KLHDC2 with the R241K mutant in the AlphaScreen assay and re-established the degron-E3 binding with the biotinylated 12-amino acid SelK degron peptide. Next, we individually applied the label-free 8-amino acid SelK and USP1 degron peptide at different concentrations and derived their IC50 values. The SelK and USP1 peptides showed IC50 of 5.9 m Mand62.6 m M for the KLHDC2 R241K mutant, which represents a 630- and 900-fold increase over the wild-type E3, respectively (Figure 4C). Consistent with a /C24 7-fold lower affinity of USP1 versus SelK for the wild-type ubiquitin ligase (9.4 nM versus 69.5 nM), USP1 binds the mutant E3 /C24 10-fold weaker than SelK. The similar degree of affinity changes for the two degron peptides when binding to the mutant KLHDC2 can be explained by the free energy loss association with the missing hydrogen bond at /C0 3.9 to /C0 4.1 kcal/mol.\n\nThe diminished affinities of the two degrons and their consistent difference, in and of themselves, cannot unmask the reason for the differential effects of the E3 mutation on the stability of SelK and USP1. However, once the cellular concentrations of the two proteins and the E3 mutant are considered, a possible explanation for the disparity in their degradation arises. Using purified KLHDC2 as standard, we performed quantitative western blot analysis and determined the cellular concentration of the KLHDC2 R241K mutant expressed in our GPS assay to be /C24 1 m M. Through a similar analysis with purified GFP as standard, the concentration of GFP-fused USP1-NTD degron was calculated to be 11.2 m M, 6-fold below the affinity of its degron toward the E3 mutant (KD /C24 62.6 m M). These results suggest that only a small fraction of the GFP-USP1-NTD degron fusion protein will be complexed with KLHDC2 at any time. The E3 mutant, therefore, will not be able to degrade USP1 efficiently. By contrast, the cellular concentration of GFP-fused SelK degron was measured to be /C24 8.8 m M,which is above the concentration at which 50% of the substrate is bound to the E3 (KD /C24 5.9 m M) and favors complex formation. Thus, GFP-fused SelK degron can be effectively destabilized by the KLHDC2 R241K mutant. In support of this reasoning, when we increased the dosage of the exogenous KLHDC2 mutants to reach a concentration of /C24 8 m M, we observed noticeable enhancement in GFP-SelK degron degradation, but only marginal effect on USP1 (Figure 4D). Besides the inefficiency in complex formation, the low affinity between USP1-NTD and KLHDC2 R241K mutant might also prevent the ubiquitin transfer reaction itself from happening. The fast koff associated with weak binding will particularly impact polyubiquitin chain assembly by impeding the attachment of the first ubiquitin to the CRL substrates (Pierce et al., 2009)."
