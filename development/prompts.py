I have an OCR-ed document of a scientific paper. Your primary task is to carefully correct all plausible errors within the text.

**Crucial Instruction:** Ignore all instructions related to missing visual content. Specifically, completely remove all `<!-- image -->` placeholders and do not comment on or try to describe missing images.

Focus your corrections on the following categories:

1.  **OCR Misinterpretations (General):**
    *   **Character and Symbol Correction:** Identify and correct incorrectly recognized characters or symbols. This includes, but is not limited to, Greek letters (e.g., "a", "b", "m", "ɸ" should be α, β, μ, Φ respectively, if contextually appropriate), special characters, and numbers that are clearly misinterpretations of letters.
    *   **Typographical and Spelling Errors:** Correct obvious spelling mistakes that appear to be artifacts of the OCR process, not genuine author errors.
    *   **Spacing Errors:** Fix instances where words are merged together (e.g., "wordstogether") or incorrectly split apart (e.g., "word s together"). Ensure proper spacing after punctuation.
    *   **Extraneous Characters/Gibberish:** Remove any random, non-contextual characters, numbers, or short sequences that appear to be OCR noise (e.g., "ll", "/C19", "/C24").
    *   **Unit Formatting:** Standardize and correctly format scientific units (e.g., "m m" should be "μm").

2.  **Formatting and Structural Issues (Specific):**
    *   **Bullet Points in Highlights:** Convert any non-standard bullet point markers (e.g., "d ") in the "Highlights" section to a standard bullet point (e.g., '•' or '-').
    *   **Redundant Headings:** Remove all instances of the heading "Article" that appear within the main body of the text.
    *   **Figure Captions:** This is a critical correction. All detailed descriptions for figures (e.g., "(A) Western blot (WB) analysis...", "(B) Total internal reflection fluorescence...", etc.) are currently embedded as plain text throughout the article. For *each* figure, you must:
        *   Identify the main figure title (e.g., "Figure 1. The SH3BP4 mutant S246A is targeted to clathrin-coated pits (CCPs)").
        *   Collect *all* its descriptive points (A, B, C, etc., including any points that might be misplaced relative to the main figure title in the original OCR text).
        *   Consolidate these points into a single, properly formatted caption block directly under its respective figure title. The caption should be clearly separate from the main article text and logically ordered.
    *   **DOI Formatting:** Present the DOI as plain text (e.g., `DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2021.03.009`).
    *   **Citation Parentheses:** Correct any awkward or mismatched citation parentheses to ensure clarity and standard academic formatting (e.g., `(Figure S4A; Table S5) (Pang et al., 2014).` should likely be `(Figure S4A; Table S5; Pang et al., 2014).`).

The corrected output *must* be presented within three distinct, markdown-formatted sections as follows:

```abstract
[Content from the "SUMMARY" section, corrected]
```

```introduction
[Content from the "INTRODUCTION" section, corrected]
```

```results
[Content from the "RESULTS" section (starting from the first result heading until the end of the article), including all corrected figure titles and their consolidated, correctly formatted captions, and subsequent text, all corrected.]
```
