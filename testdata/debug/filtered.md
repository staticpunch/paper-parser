## In brief

SH3BP4 is an endocytic adaptor. Burckhardt et al. report that SH3BP4 localization to clathrin-coated pits is regulated by Akt. Operating at the intersection of signaling and membrane trafficking, SH3BP4 mediates both internal and external cues to regulate the endocytosis of neuropilin and a 5-integrin receptors, thus modulating cell-matrix interactions.

lifetime (Figure 1I). The S246A mutant also showed more continuously positive CCPs (Figure 1J) and higher mean SH3BP4-GFP intensity at CCPs (Figures 1K, 1L, and S1N). The efficient localization of S246A to CCPs was also apparent in a different RPE cell line and in a human microvascular endothelial cell line (Figures S1OandS1T), implying that this observation can be generalized. In summary, these data suggest that the phosphorylation status at S246 regulates the incorporation of SH3BP4 into CCPs.

## SH3BP4 targeting to CCPs is blocked by 14-3-3

RSKRSYpSL around pS246 overlaps with 14-3-3 consensus binding motifs (Yaffe et al., 1997) where the phospho-group is captured by 14-3-3 (Muslin et al., 1996). Indeed, all isoforms of 14-3-3 bound SH3BP4 (Figures S2A and S2B). To confirm the interaction of SH3BP4 with the 14-3-3 ε isoform, we overexpressed SH3BP4-GFP and probed for binding of endogenous 14-3-3 ε (Figures 2A, S2C, and S2D). Consistent with previous findings, the non-phosphorylatable S246A mutant did not bind 14-3-3 ε (Chiba et al., 2009). To further study the putative loss of function caused by the interaction with 14-3-3, we introduced into SH3BP4 a 20-amino-acid peptide R18, which constitutively binds 14-3-3 (Wang et al., 1999) (Table S4). The R18 peptide was introduced upstream of S246 where it replaced a stretch of less conservedaminoacidsinSH3BP4(FigureS2E).Asexpected, SH3BP4-GFP R18 pulled down endogenous 14-3-3 ε efficiently,

to SEMA3A (Figures 8D and S8E). When SH3BP4-GFP wt and S246A were expressed in H157 the mutant protein was efficiently targeted to CCPs as observed for RPE and endothelial cells (Figures 8E, 8F, S8F and S8G). To address how the reduction of Akt activity would affect SH3BP4-GFP recruitment to CCPs, SNAP-PTEN wt was overexpressed in H157 lowering Akt pS473 levels (Figure S8H). When analyzed by TIRF microscopy, SH3BP4-GFP accumulation at CCPs was elevated in the presence of exogenous PTEN expression (Figures 8G and S8I). This was consistent with the idea that reduced Akt activity would lead to increased SH3BP4 accumulation at CCPs. Finally, to address whether active non-phosphorylatable SH3BP4 S246A could restore SEMA3A sensitivity in H157, we generated SH3BP4 KO cells and reconstituted the cells with SH3BP4-GFP (Figure S8J). When the cells were challenged with SEMA3A for 1 h, the S246A mutant cells contracted (Figure 8H). Together, these data confirm the critical role of SH3BP4 in SEMA3A signaling und supports a model where high Akt activity leads to SEMA3A resistance by phosphorylating SH3BP4 at S246. These results suggest that in cancer cells with low PTEN and high Akt activities, SH3BP4 is inactivated and cells become resistant to semaphorin signaling because of impaired SH3BP4-mediated endocytosis.

SH3BP4 not only translates via endocytosis the global Akt state to integrin surface expression but also functions as an integrator of signals from cell surface receptors that regulate integrin availability. Here, we show how the semaphorin SEMA3A via its receptor NRP1 activates SH3BP4 and promotes cell contraction, effects that are well established but have yet to be mechanistically explained (Serini et al., 2003). Our data now indicate that acute exposure of cells to SEMA3A enhances SH3BP4 recruitment to CCPs and that SH3BP4 knockout reduces SEMA3A induced cell contraction (Figure 7). SEMA3A induced cell contraction is thought to depend mostly on NRP1 signaling (Gioelli et al., 2018). Besides NRP1, SEMA3A also binds plexinA, which leads to the activation of the cytoplasmic GAP domain toward the Rap1 GTPase (Wang et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013; Gioelli et al., 2018). SEMA3A reduces the activity of Rap1 and its various downstream effectors (Bos et al., 2001). This has been reported to inhibit cell migration but it does not trigger cell

contraction (Gioelli et al., 2018). Our data support a model where SEMA3A signaling activates PTEN to reduce Akt activity.

Throughout tumorigenesis, cancer cells receive a plethora of signals from their microenvironment, including from chemorepellents like semaphorins. We found that hyperphosphorylation of SH3BP4 at S246 by Akt contributes to SEMA3A resistance in NSCLCs. Conversely, reconstitution with the non-phosphorylatable mutant SH3BP4 sensitized cells for SEMA3A. These data offer mechanistic insight to earlier reports of semaphorin resistance in cells with high Akt expression. In NSCLCs, PTEN mutations were found in 1%-3% of lung adenocarcinoma patients and in up to 15%-22% of squamous cell carcinoma patients (Campbell et al., 2016; Cancer Genome Atlas Research, 2012, 2014, Sanchez-Vega et al., 2018). This suggests that a considerable fraction of NSCLCs could invoke a semaphorin resistance mechanism through the loss of PTEN together with enhanced Akt activity and inhibition of SH3BP4-mediated endocytosis. While hyperactive Akt may be a frequent semaphorin resistance mechanism, other pathways may likely co-exist.

Most of the current models of CME describe a constitutive protein assembly process at the plasma membrane orchestrated by the adaptor AP-2 complex and clathrin together with a range of accessory factors with overlapping functionality (Schmid and McMahon, 2007). However, various receptors are not constitutively loaded into CCPs. Thus, incorporation must be tightly controlled, yet mechanisms for such regulation have been elusive. Here, we describe how phosphorylation in response to cellintrinsic or extrinsic signaling via Akt selectively determines the incorporation of the accessory factor SH3BP4 into CCPs upon which NRP1 and a 5-integrins are internalized by CME. Most certainly, SH3BP4isonlyoneamongseveralCCP-associatedfactorsthattransiently engagewiththeCMEmachineryinresponseto signaling inputs. Our experiments now dissect the regulation for one of this vastly understudied class of CME adaptors with potentially central roles as an integrator of signaling and trafficking.

## Limitations of the study

Interestingly, NRP1 endocytosis was previously shown to be sensitive to the nutritional state of cells, wherein, particularly, insulin signaling strongly inhibited the uptake of NRP1-binding ligands (Pang et al., 2014). Insulin binds the insulin receptor, followed by tyrosine-kinase activation, recruitment of IRS-1/2 adapters, and finally activation of PI3K and Akt (Haeusler et al., 2018). In independent, unrelated studies SH3BP4 S246 phosphorylation was reported to be enhanced by insulin signaling measured by mass spectrometry (Humphrey et al., 2013, 2015). These observations line-up with our data showing SH3BP4 as a central switch between PI3K/Akt signaling and endocytosis. However, Pang et al. found that their NRP1 peptide ligand attached to silver nanoparticles entered cells independent of the CME machinery but identified internalized particles in vesicles resembling macropinosomes (Pang et al., 2014). Although our data indicate that NRP1 is internalized in an SH3BP4- and

CME-dependent way, we cannot exclude the possibility that NRP1follows alternative endocytic routes. The mode of internalization of NRP1 may depend on the nature of the ligand and the metabolic and signaling state of the cell.

The human retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) immortalized with human Telomerase (hTERT) (Jiang et al., 1999) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (hTERT RPE, sex: female, ATCC, Manassas, VA, CRL-4000) and grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium DMEM/F-12 (1:1, Gibco, 11330-032), 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma F0926) and antibiotic-antimycotic (AA, Gibco, containing 10,000 units/mL penicillin, 10,000 m g/mL streptomycin 25 m g/mL amphotericin B, 15240062). Human retinal pigment epithelium ARPE-19/HPV-16 cells were obtained from ATCC (CRL-2502, sex: male). ARPE-19/HPV-16 cells are ARPE19 cells transformed with human papillomavirus-16 DNA by transfection (ATCC). The parental ARPE-19 cell line arose spontaneously in culture (Dunn et al., 1996). Cells were maintained in DMEM/F-12, 10 % FBS and AA. Human brain microvascular endothelial cells hCMEC/D3,that were originally immortalized with hTERT and SV40 large T antigen (Weksler et al., 2005) were obtained from Millipore (Millipore, SCC066, sex: female). Cells were grown in EndoGRO-MV Media Kit (Millipore, SCME004) according to manufacturer's instructions. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells Lenti-X 293T (Takara, 632180) were grown in DMEM (Gibco, 11995-065), supplemented with 10 % FBS and AA. Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells HMEC1 were obtained from ATCC (CRL-3243, sex: male) and grown in MCDB 131 medium (Gibco, 10372019) supplemented with microvascular growth supplement (Gibco, S00525). The non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell A549 (sex: male), H1299 (male), H2009 (female), H157 (male), HCC193 (female), HCC44 (female), H1473 (NA), H1819 (female) and H2052 (male) were obtained from the Hamon Cancer Center Collection (UT Southwestern Medical Center) and described previously (Gazdar et al., 2010). Cell line identity was confirmed by DNA fingerprinting (PowerPlex 1.2 Kit, Promega) and mycoplasma-free status was verified by PCR (e-Myco Kit, Boca Scientific, 25235). Cells were grown in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium (Gibco, 11875-093) supplemented with 5 % FBS and AA. All cells were cultured in humidified incubators (Nuaire) with 5 % CO2 at 37 /C14 Celsius (37 /C14 C). For starvation experiments, cells were cultured in serum free and low glucose DMEM (Gibco, 11885-084) with 1 g/L D-glucose and AA. For passaging, cells were washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, composed of 137 mM NaCl (Research Products International, RPI, S23020), 2.7 mM KCl (Fisher Scientific, BP366), 10 mM Na2HPO4 (RPI, S23100), 1.8 mM KH2PO4 (Fisher Scientific, BP362), incubated in 0.5 % trypsin-EDTA solution (GIBCO, 15400-054) until cells detached and resuspended in full medium. Cell concentrations were determined using an automated cell counter (Cellometer Auto 1000, Nexcelom, Lawrence, MA).

Coralville, IA, for all oligonucleotides see Table S6) with EcoRI and KpnI restriction sites by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using PFUultra II Fusion HS DNA polymerase (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, 600674-51 ), dNTP mix (BioBasic, DD0057) in a thermal cycler (BioRad, Hercules, CA, C1000 Touch, 1851148). PCR products were purified on 1 % agarose gels (Fisher Scientific, BP160) in Tris-acetic acid-EDTA (TAE) buffer containing 40 mM Tris (Fisher Scientific, BP152), 20 mM glacial acetic acid (Fisher, BP2401SI-212) and 1 mM Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, di-Sodium salt dihydrate (EDTA, Fisher Scientific, BP120) with ethidium bromide (Bio-Rad, 1610433) by electrophoresis (Bio-Rad, 1704406). Gels were imaged on a GBOX imaging system with a Synoptics 4.2 MP camera and Genesys software (all Syngene, Frederick, MD). DNA bands were excised and solubilized in PB/QG buffer composed of 3M guaninidine-thiocyanate (Sigma, G9277), 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.6, 5 % ethanol (Pharmaco, 111000190). DNA was purified on mini spin columns (Sydlab, Natick, MA, MB082) and eluted in ultrapure water (Millipore Synergy UV, Biopak filter CDUFBI001). The pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, 6085-1) was first modified at position alanine-206 of EGFP by site directed mutagenesis (as described below, for oligonucleotides see Table S6) to introduce an alanine to lysine (A206K) mutation to reduce GFP dimerization (Zacharias et al., 2002). Plasmid and PCR DNA were digested with EcoRI-HF (New England Biolabs, NEB Ipswich, MA, R3101) and KpnI-HF (NEB, R3142) in cutsmart buffer (NEB, B7204) at 37 /C14 C according to manufacturer protocols. Plasmid DNA was dephosphorylated with calf intestine phosphatase (CIP, NEB, M0290) at 37 /C14 C and purified on a 1 % agarose gel as described above. Plasmid and PCR DNA were ligated with T4 ligase (NEB, M0202) at room temperature for 10 min followed by prolonged incubation at 16 /C14 Cin the thermal cycler. Ligation products were transformed into XL1- blue E.coli cells (Agilent, 200236) by a 10 min incubation on ice, followed by 90 seconds heat shock at 42 /C14 C in a water bath (Thermo Scientific) before cells were chilled again on ice. Cells were grown out in Luria-Bertani broth (LB broth Miller, Millipore, 71753-5) medium for 30 min at 37 /C14 C, spun down, resuspended in LB medium and plated on LB-agarose plates containing 10 m g/ml Kanamycin sulfate (Fisher Scientific, BP906-5) for selection. The next day, colonies were collected and grown in LB medium in the presence of 10 m g/ml Kanamycin. Cultures were harvested and plasmid DNAwasextracted using standard DNA extraction protocols and spin columns (Sydlab). The DNA was analyzed by restriction digest and constructs containing the insert of the expected size were sequenced (Genewiz, South Plainfield, NJ). To introduce amino acid changes in the pEGFP-N1 SH3BP4-GFP construct at motifs relevant for clathrin mediated endocytosis and at phosphorylation sites, standard site directed mutagenesis protocols were applied, using PFU Ultra II DNA polymerase and oligonucleotides containing the respective altered nucleotides (IDT DNA, for oligonucleotides see Table S6). Briefly, oligonucleotides were annealed in a temperature gradient ranging from 55-68 /C14 C, DNA was amplified at 68 /C14 Cfor one min per kilobase of DNA, for 18 cycles with a final extension at 72 /C14 Cfor up to 20 min. The input plasmid DNA was digested with DpnI (NEB, R0176) for 3 h at 37 /C14 Cin the thermal cycler. PCR products were purified over spin columns in PB/QG buffer and transformed into XL1-blue cells and processed as described above. The resulting constructs were sequenced (Genewiz). To obtain constructs with multiple mutations, nucleotide changes were introduced sequentially. The same procedure was applied to generate the GFP-GIPC1 LGL/AAA PDZ domain mutant construct and the GFP-PTEN G251C mutant construct (for oligonucleotides see Table S6).

For transient expression experiments in HEK cells, including all immunoprecipitation experiments, GFP fusion constructs were established in pEGFP vectors (Clontech). For the GFP-GIPC1 expression constructs, the cDNA for human GIPC1 (PlasmidID Harvard, HsCD00040225) was inserted into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) using XhoI and EcoRI (NEB). For pEGFP-N1 Dyn2-GFP human Dyn2 (Srinivasan et al., 2018) was inserted using EcoRI and KpnI restriction sites. For pEGFP-N1 CLTC-TD-GFP, human CLTC terminal domain (TD) the N-terminal 579 amino acids of human CLTC (plasmidID Harvard: HsCD00339048) were amplified by PCR and subcloned with XhoI and HindIII (NEB, R0104). For pEGFP-C1 NRP1 cytoplasmic tail constructs the 44 C-terminal amino acid cytoplasmic portion of human NRP1 (Thermo, Ultimate ORF, clone IOH81223) were inserted using XhoI and EcoRI (both NEB) in frame with GFP. For the dSEA mutant, the last three amino acids were omitted. For all 14-3-3-GFP isoform fusion constructs PCR products were subcloned into pEGFP-N1 as described above (for cDNA see Table S7, for oligonucleotides and restriction enzymes see Table S6).

For biochemistry experiments FLAG-tag and influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) tag were first introduced in pcDNA 3.1 vector. In brief, two overlapping oligonucleotides were annealed and expanded using PFU Ultra DNA polymerase (for Oligonucleotides see supplementary Table S6), agarose gel purified and extracted (small DNA extraction kit, IBI Scientific, IB47061), digested with HindIII and KpnI (NEB) and ligated into pcDNA 3.1 as described above. Next, cDNAs (all human) for SH3BP4, GIPC1, GIPC2 (Thermo Ultimate ORF lite, IOH27252), EPS15 (Thermo, IOH46773), YWHAE (PlasmidID Harvard, HsCD0005020) were inserted in frame with FLAG-HA tags into the pcDNA 3.1 FLAG-HA construct as described above, for oligonucleotides and restriction enzymes, see Table S6. For human GIPC3 continuous cDNA could not be obtained, two independent clones (Dharmacon, MHS6278-211687736, clone ID: 40125863) exhibited an approximately 20 bp deletion in the GC rich 5 0 part. Instead, for the 5' 240 bp region, single-stranded DNA designed with reduced GC content in the 5 0 114 bp and 30 bp for DNA assembly was ordered (gBlock, IDT DNA, see Table S6). The remaining part was amplified with 30 bp overhangs and assembled by homologous recombination in yeast as described below and the resulting construct was verified by Sanger sequencing (Genewiz). For transient overexpression of Akt1-wt-HA, DNA was amplified (DNA from 896 pcDNA3 T7 Akt1 was a gift from William Sellers, Addgene plasmid # 9003; http://n2t.net/addgene:9003; RRID:Addgene\_9003) with a reverse primer to insert a HA tag and subcloned into pcDNA 3.1 using EcoRI and XhoI (NEB) as described above. To establish stable expression of SH3BP4-GFP-fusion in human cells, constructs were subcloned into the pLVX lentiviral vector (Clontech, neo: Cat# 632181, puro: 632183) where expression is driven by human cytomegalovirus immediate early promotor (hCMV) and neomycin or puromycin resistance genes follow after an internal ribosomal entry site. For subcloning SnaBI (NEB, R0130) and NotI-HF (NEB, R3189) were used. The same approach was used for Dyn2-GFP, Eps15-GFP, Eps15SNAP, GFP-NRP1, cytosolic GFP, GAP-GFP, GFP-PTEN, SNAP-PTEN and constitutively active Akt1-SNAP expression. To assemble the SNAP-PTEN and Eps15-SNAP constructs, the SNAP-tag was amplified from pSNAP-f (NEB, N9183S). For the TIRF

clathrin coated pit localization assay a membrane targeted GFP was designed as a negative control. To localize GFP to the plasma membrane the first 20 amino acids of neuroglobulin/GAP43 were introduced into pEGFP-N1 in frame with GFP. The N-terminal peptide was previously found sufficient for membrane and Golgi targeting (Liu et al., 1994). The peptide is palmitoylated at Cys3 and Cys4 and anchored to the lipid bilayer (Skene and Virag, 1989). For rescue experiments in the RPE GIPC1 knockout cells an N-terminally 10x Histidine tagged- (HIS)-GIPC1 was generated by using oligonucleotides encoding the His-tag for PCR and subcloning the product into pLVX puro with EcoRI and XbaI (NEB). To rescue NRP1 function in the RPE NRP1 KO cells, a lentiviral GFP-NRP1 full-length fusion constructs was assembled in yeast by homologous recombination as described below. The NRP1 N-terminal 21 amino acid signal peptide was followed by GFP, which in turn was spaced from NRP1 by a six amino acid glycine-serine linker (GGSGGS). The three pieces (for oligonucleotides see Table S6) were assembled in pRS424 shuttle vector by homologous recombination in yeast as described below. The resulting fusion piece was transferred to pLVX puro lentiviral vector for stable expression. After infection, RPE cells were flow sorted and analyzed by western blotting (see below). To enhance Akt signaling a lentiviral expression construct was made in two steps, first myr-dPH-Akt1, a membrane targeted constitutively active version was amplified by PCR (1017 pcDNA3 Myr Akt1 deltaPH was a gift from William Sellers, Addgene plasmid # 9009; http://n2t.net/addgene:9009; RRID:Addgene\_9009) and introduced into pEGFP-N1. Next, the GFP fusion construct was subcloned into pLVX-puro as described above. For pEGFP-N1 GIPC1GFP constructs, EcoRI and BamHI sites were used. For expression of the GFP-PTEN fusion, the PTEN cDNA (Thermo, IOH56926) was amplified using primers with XhoI and BamHI restriction sites and inserted into pEGFP-C1 as described above. Subsequently, the GFP-PTEN insert was subcloned into pLVX puro. For expression of recombinant GST-SH3BP4-HIS8x in Ecoli, where SH3BP4 is GST-tagged at the N-term and contains an 8x histidine tag at the C-term, oligonucleotides introducing restriction sites and His-tag were used and the PCR product was introduced into pGEX-6P-1 (GE Healthcare) with EcoRI and NotI (NEB). The analogous strategy was employed to generate a pGEX-6P-1 GST-GIPC1-HIS8x expression vector.

The constructs for GIPC3, SP-HIS6x-SEMA3A, Eps15-SNAP, constitutively active Akt1-SNAP, SNAP-PTEN and the SH3BP4 R18 mutant constructs were assembled by homologous recombination in yeast S.cerevisiae. To this end, oligonucleotides with 30 bp overhangs were designed and DNA fragments were amplified by PCR and purified on agarose gels as described above. The pRS424 plasmid DNA containing the TRP1 marker (Christianson et al., 1992) was digested with KpnI-HF, NotI-HF and SmaI (NEB, R0141) for linearization and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and gel extraction. For transformation, linear pRS424 and the DNA fragments were mixed with 260 m l Poly-ethylene glycol (PEG, average Mn 4000, Sigma, 81240, 50 % w/v in sterile water), 36 m l 1 M Lithium-acetate (in water, Sigma 517992) salmon sperm DNA carrier (Invitrogen, 15632-011) and competent yeast YPH500 (Cermak et al., 2011), that were prepared according to established protocols (Gietz and Schiestl, 2007). Cells were incubated for 22 min at 42 /C14 C in the water bath, spun down, and plated on tryptophan deficient yeast synthetic drop out plates. Synthetic drop out plates were prepared from 6.7 g Yeast Nitrogen Base (w/o amino acids, Difco, Becton Dickinson, 291940), 2 g of amino acid mix without Tryptophan (manually mixed, all amino acids were obtained from Sigma), 15 g agar (bacteriological type A, Affymetrix, 10906), 2 % D-glucose (Dextrose, Fisher Scientific, D16). Plates were incubated at 30 /C14 C until colonies formed. To obtain plasmid DNA, cells were harvested from plates, digested with zymolase and extracted according to manufacturer's instructions (Zymoprep Yeast Plasmid Miniprep II, Zymo Research, D2004). The eluted plasmid DNA was transformed into XL1-blue competent cells (NEB) and grown on ampicillin (100 m g/ml, Sigma, A-9518) selective LB-agar plates. Colonies were expanded, plasmid DNA was extracted and analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion and Sanger sequencing as described above. To obtain an SH3BP4 mutant that mimics S246 phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding, the 20 amino acid long 14-3-3 binding peptide R18 (Wang et al., 1999) was introduced upstream of the last NPF motif and the S246 phosphorylation site. It replaced an un-conserved region of SH3BP4 with considerable amino acid sequence heterogeneity. As a negative control the double lysine mutant version of the R18 peptide was used (Wang et al., 1999).

## mRNA extraction, cDNA generation and sequencing

One million H157, HCC193 and H1819 NSCLC cells were harvested by trypsinization and mRNA was extracted using the RNAeasy mini kit (Qiagen, 74106) following the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA was generated using SuperScript IV (Thermo Scientific, 18091050). In brief, 1 m g mRNA, oligo-d(T)18 primer (NEB, S1316S) and dNTPs (Bio Basic) were heated to 65 /C14 C for 5 min and annealed on ice for 3 min. SuperScript IV master mix was added and the reverse transcriptase reaction was run for 10 min at 52C before the enzyme was inactivated at 80 /C14 C for 10 min. The PTEN cDNA was amplified by PCR yielding a 1.2 kb product (Figure S8C, for oligonucleotides see Table S6) on a 1 % agarose gel. The band was extracted and purified as described above and processed for Sanger sequencing (Genewiz, for oligonucleotides used for PTEN sequencing see Table S6). For H157 the G251C mutation was confirmed while for HCC193 and H1819 cells no mutations were found in PTEN.

## siRNA knockdown of clathrin heavy chain

To assess the effect of clathrin mediated endocytosis on neuropilin-1 and a 5-integrin endocytosis a knockdown of clathrin heavy chain was performed. To this end 120 K wild type RPE cells were seeded in 6 well plates. The following day cells were transfected with 30 pmol each of two siRNAs targeting clathrin heavy chain (CHC, Sigma, see Table S8 for sequences) or equivalent amounts of AllStars negative control siRNA (Qiagen, 1027281) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Thermo, 13778-150) in Opti-MEM medium (Gibco, 31985-070) as recommended by the manufacturer. The transfection was repeated on day 2. On day 3, 10 K cells were seeded for the

## CRISPR/Cas9 knockout cells

For CRISPR/Cas9 experiments, 200-500 bp of the first or second exon were used to find optimal guide-RNA targeting sequences on the web site of the Zhang lab at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT, www.crispr.mit.edu (Ran et al., 2013)) or optimal targeting sequences were retrieved from the Lum lab at UT Southwestern Medical Center website (www.crispinator.com (Tuladhar et al., 2019)). Oligonucleotides (IDT DNA) with overhangs compatible with BbsI restriction enzyme were designed for insertion into pX458 pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP (Cas9 wt) or pSpCAS9n(BB)-2A-puro (Cas9 nickase, Addgene # 48138, #48139, respectively, the plasmids were a gift from Feng Zhang, MIT), as described in detail (Ran et al., 2013) (for oligonucleotide see Table S6). In brief, forward and reverse oligonucleotides were mixed and phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (T4 PNK, M0201, NEB) for 30 min at 37 /C14 C in T4 ligase buffer (NEB, M0202). For duplex formation, the reaction mix was heated to 95 /C14 C for 5 min and slowly cooled downto room temperature in the thermal cycler (Bio-Rad). The pSpCas9 vectors were digested with BbsI-HF (NEB, R3539), dephosphorylated with CIP, purified on a 1 % agarose gel and extracted from the gel using extraction procedures and spin columns as described above. The oligonucleotide duplexes and digested pSpCas9 were ligated with T4 DNA ligase as described and unligated linear DNA was digested by addition of Plasmid Safe ATP dependent Nuclease (Epicentre, E3101K), 0.5 mM ATP (Biobasic, AB0311) and 1x plasmid safe nuclease buffer (Epicentre) for 30 min at 37 /C14 Cand heat inactivated at 70 /C14 Cfor 10 min. Reaction products were transformed into XL1-blue as described above. Resulting clones were analyzed by Sanger sequencing (Genewiz). Plasmid DNA was prepared using silica-based spin columns (Econo-Spin, Epoch Lifescience, 2040) according to standard protocols. For gene targeting, cells were transfected by electroporation using the NEON system (Thermo Scientific, MPK5000). Cells were washed once with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), incubated with 0.5 % trypsin-EDTA solution (GIBCO, 15400-054) until they detached, collected in culture medium and harvested by centrifugation. Cells were washed once with PBS and resuspended at 5*10 6 cells/ml. To each 100 m l of cell suspension, 8 m g Cas9-wt plasmid DNA was added. For Cas9-nickase, the cell suspension was mixed with 0.1 m g/ 100 m l pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) plasmid as a transfection marker. Sequentially, multiple volumes of 100 m l of cell suspension were pulsed twice at 1400 V for 20 ms and resuspended in culture medium. The next day, the medium was refreshed, and cells were expanded for fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). For single cell sorting cells were detached with trypsin, harvested in culture medium, washed once with PBS, resuspended in PBS and cell aggregates were removed by subjecting the suspension to a 40 m m nylon cell strainer (Falcon, 352340). For single cell sorting, 96 well plates (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, Spectra Plate-96 TC, 6005650) were coated with gelatin solution (Attachment Factor, Gibco, S-006-100) for 30 min at 37 /C14 C. Next, single GFP positive cells were sorted into 96 well plates on a FACS Aria II SORP flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, UT Southwestern Children's Medical Center Research Institute Moody Foundation Flow Cytometry facility) using the 488 nm laser settings. Cell colonies were inspected on an inverted microscope (Nikon, Eclipse TS100) with a 4x objective (Nikon, Plan Fluor 4x, NA 0.13) and expanded. Protein expression was assessed by western blotting as described below.

## Lentiviral expression

In RPE SH3BP4 knockout cells, expression was reconstituted by SH3BP4-GFP fusion proteins. To establish stable expression of SH3BP4-GFP wt and mutant fusion constructs and expression of Eps15-GFP, Dyn2-GFP, GFP-NRP1 fluorescent reporter constructs in human cells a lentiviral transduction system was used. To this end, pLVX based constructs were transfected into HEK 293Tcells together with packaging vectors psPAX2 (HIV-1 gag and pol) and pMD2.G (VSV-G, both plasmids obtained from Addgene, #12260 and #12259, respectively, plasmids were a gift from Didier Trono, EPFL Lausanne, Switzerland). For HEK cell transfection, standard polyethylenimine (PEI, linear, MW 25 K, Polysciences, 23966) protocols were used. In brief, 30 m l PEI (1 mg/ml in H2O, pH 7.0) and 10 m g plasmid DNA each in 0.5 ml serum free DMEM medium were mixed and incubated for 15 min at room temperature before the transfection mix was added to the cells. Virus was harvested two days post transfection and filtered through 0.45 m m mixed cellulose esters membrane syringe filters (Fisher Scientific, MCE, 09-720-005,) and added to the cells. The next day the medium was exchanged, and cells were selected with puromycin dihydrochloride (Gibco, A1113802) or Geneticin (G418 sulfate, Gibco, 10131-035) or left unselected. After a couple of days of expansion, fluorescent cells were sorted on a FACS Aria II SORP flow cytometer equipped with a 488 nm and 633 nm laser (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and expanded for analysis. Cells were further characterized by western blotting and microscopy as described below.

## Expression and purification of Semaphorin-3a

For expression and purification of active human semaphorin-3a protein (SEMA3A, cDNA from Dharmacon, 40034963), a histidine tag (HIS6x) was introduced at the N-term of the mature protein in frame with the signal peptide. To obtain higher yields of uncleaved protein a furin protease cleavage site was removed by introducing the R551A, R555A mutations (RRAA) (Adams et al., 1997) with overlapping primers by DNA assembly in yeast as described below (for oligonucleotides see Table S6). The His-tag semaphorin-3a fusion was subcloned into the shuttle vector pAd-tet-T3T7 using HindIII (NEB, R0104) and NotI-HF. The pAd-tet-T3T7 is a modification of pAdlox (Hardy et al., 1997) where the CMV promoter was replaced with a tetracycline responsive promoter as described previously (Altschuler et al., 1998). It contains a J packaging sequence, a single loxP site for cre recombination, a multiple cloning site followed by a poly-adenylation signal. Helper Adenovirus DNA was purified as described (Hardy et al., 1997). HEK 293 Cre-4 (Merck) that

## Western blotting and antibodies

For sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) 1 mm thick gels were manually casted using the miniprotean system (Bio-Rad, 1658001FC) using standard protocols. In brief, the separation gel contained 375 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 10 % acrylamide (from 40 % Acrylamide/Bis Solution, 37.5:1, Bio-Rad, 1610148), 0.1 % SDS (Thermo Scientific, 28365), and polymerization was catalyzed with tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED, Bio-Rad, 161-0800) and ammonium persulfate (Thermo Scientific, 17874). Stacking gels were made of 5 % acrylamide, 125 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, and were polymerized as for the separation gels. Gels contained 10 or 15 wells, depending on the number of samples. Samples were run at 100 V for at least 90 min or until appropriate protein separation was observed (Power Pac Basic, Bio-Rad, 1645050). Gels were run in electrode buffer that contained 25 mM Tris, 190 mM glycine (Fisher Scientific, BP381-5) and 0.1 % SDS. Proteins were transferred to methanol (Pharmco-Aaper, 339000000CSGL) activated PVDF membranes (0.45 m m, Thermo Scientific, 88518), packed between Whatman paper (3MM-CHR GE Healthcare, 3030-917) in transfer buffer containing 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine (Fisher Scientific, BP381) and 10 % ethanol for 1 h at 400 mAmp in 4 /C14 C. Subsequently, membranes were blocked in Tris buffered saline with tween (TBST) composed of 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris, 2.7 mM KCl, adjusted to pH7.4, 0.05 % Tween-20 (Fisher Scientific, BP337), containing 10 % milk. For protein detection, antibodies specific to SH3BP4 (mouse, Santa Cruz Biotechnology (SCBT), sc393730), SH3BP4 (mouse, 2992C1a, Abcam, ab84853), GIPC1 (rabbit, Proteintech, 14822-1-AP), neuropilin-1 (rabbit, Abcam, ab81321), 14-3-3ε (mouse, 8C3, SCBT, sc23957), myosin-6 (rabbit, SCBT,H-215, sc50461), ARHGEF12/Larg (rabbit, H-70, SCBT, sc25638), a 5-integrin (rabbit, EPR7854, Abcam, ab150361), Akt (pan, rabbit, C67E7, Cell Signaling Technology (CST), 4691), phospho-Akt Ser473 (pS473, rabbit, D9E, CST, 4060), phospho-Akt Thr308 (rabbit, C31E5E, CST, 2965), actin (mouse, Sigma, AC-15, A1978), dynamin-2 (goat, SCBT, sc6400), Eps15 (rabbit, Schmid laboratory, UTSW), vimentin (mouse, V9, Sigma, V6630), vimentin (rabbit, SCBT, C-20, sc7557), SNAP tag (rabbit, NEB, P9310) semaphorin-3a (rabbit, Abcam, ab23393), green fluorescent protein, GFP (mouse, Roche, 11814460001), influenza virus hemagglutinin HA-tag (rabbit, Sigma, SAB4300603), penta-Histidine tag (mouse, Qiagen, 34660), PTEN (rabbit, CST, D4.3, 9188), E-cadherin (rabbit, CST, 24E10, 3195), GAPDH (rabbit, CST, D16H11, 5174), clathrin heavy chain (mouse, manufactured by BioXCell, Lebanon, NH, clone TD.1) were used (see Table S6 for all antibodies used and corresponding research resource ID, RRID). Membranes were incubated with antibodies in TBST containing 5 % milk or 5 % bovine serum albumin (BSA, Equitech-Bio, BAH65) over night at 4 /C14 C, rocking. Membranes were washed three times for at least 20 min in TBST and incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, goat anti mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, 115-035-003) goat anti rabbit (Jackson, 111-035-003) and donkey anti goat (Abcam, ab97110) for 1 h at room temperature before membranes were washed again three times with TBST. Membranes were incubated in custom made enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) solution containing 100 mM Tris pH 8.5, 2.5 mM p-Coumaric acid (Sigma, C9008), 1.2 mM Luminol (Sigma, A8511), 0.01 % H2O2 (Alfa Aesar, L14000), or for weak signals with SuperSignal West Femto (Thermo Scientific, 34095) and imaged on a GBOX imaging system (Syngene, as described above). For image inversion, cropping, and intensity adjustments, Fiji/ImageJ (1.53c and earlier versions, NIH) software was used (Schindelin et al., 2012). Protein band intensities were quantified with Image studio light (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE) software, statistical analysis rank sum test or Student's t test was used and plotting of summary data was done in Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA, R2018a).

Toassess protein expression in non-small cell lung cancer cells, 3 million cells were seeded in 10 cm dishes and harvested the next day using cell scrapers as described above. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mM Tris (Fisher Scientific), pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl (RPI), 0.5 % NP40 (Fluka) and HALT Protease and Phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific, 1861281). Samples were processed for western blotting and analysis as described above. Each blot contained a control lysate from RPE wt cells for normalization across all cell lines and all experimental repeats. The protein band intensities were normalized with actin or GAPDH loading controls and then normalized with the RPE sample. The phospho-Akt pS573 band intensities were additionally normalized with total Akt. Experiments were repeated at least five times, and mean +/- standard error (SEM) are shown.

For purification of HIS6x-SEMA3A (RRAA), confluent dishes of HEK 293T were infected with adenovirus expressing semaphorin-3a and tTA helper virus (see above) and the medium was harvested the next day. To prevent unspecific protein binding to the Ni-NTA resin (Invitrogen, R901-15), the NaCl concentration was adjusted to 500 mM and 10 mM imidazole (Acros organics, 12202) were added, together with 1 mM Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride to reduce proteolysis (PMSF, Sigma, 517992). The protein was bound to Ni-NTA agarose overnight, rocking at 4 /C14 C. The beads were harvested, applied to a Poly-prep chromatography column (BioRad, 731-1550) and washed at 4 /C14 C with PBS containing 500 mM NaCl and 25 mM Imidazole. The HIS6x-SEMA3A was eluted with increasing concentrations of imidazole and 500ul fractions were collected. For analysis, 16 m l of the samples were mixed with 6x sample buffer containing 375 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 9 % Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, Thermo Scientific, 28365), 50 % Glycerol (Fisher Scientific, BP229) and 0.03 % Bromophenol blue (Bio-Rad, 161-0404) under non-reducing condition to preserve semaphorin-3a dimers. The samples were heated for 5 min at 95 /C14 C and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described

above. Gels were stained with Aquastain blue (Bulldog Bio, AS001000) and destained in tap water and the fractions containing SEMA3A were pooled and dialyzed three times in PBS for 30 min at 4 /C14 C each using Slide-A-lyzer dialysis cassettes (10 kDa cutoff, Thermo, 66380). The protein was collected, protein concentration was determined using a BCA assay (Thermo Scientific, 23225) and a microplate reader (Synergy-H1, BioTek, Winooski, VT). The protein concentration was adjusted, samples were aliquoted, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 /C14 C until use.

For expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins for SH3BP4 and GIPC1 the corresponding pGEX-6P-1 constructs were transformed into BL21 cells (DE3, NEB, C2527I) as described above. Small cultures were grown in LB medium rocking overnight at 37 /C14 C. Large cultures were started and OD600 was observed regularly and when it reached 0.8-1, protein expression was induced with 1 mM Isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG, Goldbio, I2481), and cultures were grown overnight at 22 /C14 C. Cells were harvested and subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen. Next, cells were resuspended in ice cold PBS containing 1 mM PMSF, oComplete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT, Goldbio), 1 % Triton-X100 (Fisher Scientific, BP151). Cells were sonicated at 40 % amplitude for 3 times 10 seconds (Fisher Scientific, model FB505) at 4 /C14 C and rocked in the cold for 10 min to solubilize proteins. Lysates were spun at 12'000 rpm for 10 min at 4 /C14 C (Beckman Coulter) and supernatants were harvested. Glutathione-agarose (ABT, 4B-GLU-100) was washed with PBS, added to the cell lysates and rocked overnight at 4 /C14 C. Next, the beads were washed three times in PBS at 4 /C14 C and eluted with 5 mM reduced L-glutathione (Sigma, G4251) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The eluted proteins were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining as described above. As a second purification step, NaCl concentration was adjusted to 500 mM, 10 mM imidazole, and Ni-NTA-resin were added and bound over night, rocking at 4 /C14 C. The next day, the resin was collected on a column, washed, and eluted as described above. Then, eluted GST-GIPC1-HIS8x fractions were pooled and dialyzed in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol for three times 20 min at 4 /C14 C. Next, the protein was digested with precision protease (GE life sciences, 27084301) at 4 /C14 C overnight. To sequester the protease and cleaved GST, the protein solution was incubated with glutathione-agarose as described above and the supernatant was collected. The GIPC1-HIS8x was rebound to Ni-NTA resin, eluted in a small volume, analyzed, and stored as described above until use.

## Immunoprecipitation and pull-down experiments

For protein-protein interaction studies by immunoprecipitation (IP), unless stated otherwise, HEK cells were used. Cells were transfected with plasmids encoding GFP and HA-tagged fusion constructs using PEI methods as described above. For experiments involving overexpression of Akt1-wt-HA kinase constructs, cells were starved for 12 h in serum free low glucose DMEM (Gibco, 11885-084, 1 g/L D-Glucose), containing AA. The next day, cells were washed once with PBS, harvested with cell culture spatulas (Techno Plastic Products, TPP, 99010) on ice, spun down in a table top centrifuge at 4 /C14 C. The supernatant was removed and 1 ml lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris (Fisher Scientific), pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl (RPI), 0.5 % NP40 (Fluka) and oComplete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, 11697498001) and phosphatase inhibitors Sodium fluoride (1 mM, Fisher Scientific, S299), Sodium orthovanadate (1 mM, Fisher Scientific, S454), Sodium pyrophosphate decahydrate (1 mM, Sigma, 221368), b -Glycerophosphate disodium salt hydrate (1 mM, Sigma, G5422) were added. Cells were sonicated once for 10 seconds at 20 % amplitude (Fisher Scientific) andfurther incubated at 4 /C14 Crotating for 30 min. Samples were spun down at maximum speed at 4 /C14 Candsupernatant was collected. Protein-G-agarose (ABT, 4RRPG-5) was washed with lysis buffer once and spun down. To each sample 0.8 m g of mouse anti-GFP antibody (Roche, 11814460001) and 30 m l of protein-G-agarose beads were added and samples were incubated at 4 /C14 C rotating overnight. Beads were harvested by centrifugation at 700rpm and 4 /C14 C, washed three times with lysis buffer and resuspended in 6x sample buffer as described above containing 10 % b -mercaptoethanol (BME, Fisher Scientific, BP176) and heated at 95 /C14 C for 5 min. Both the immunoprecipitation and supernatant control samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting as described above. For the supernatant 1/50 th of the sample was loaded. Protein band intensities for bait and preys were quantified with Image studio light (Li-cor) and results were normalized with the signal from the GFP-fusion protein. The data were analyzed and plotted with Matlab. For experiments with five or more repeats, the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for statistical analysis. For experiments with three or four repeats Student's t test was used for statistical analysis. For immunoprecipitation experiments with three or more repeats, three independent experiments were performed on independent days. For experiments with more than three repeats, multiple repeats per day were included.

To test in-vitro binding of recombinant full-length GST-SH3BP4-HIS8x and GIPC1-HIS8x, purified GST and GST-SH3BP4-HIS8x were re-bound to glutathione-agarose in buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 % NP40, protease inhibitor cocktail (HALT cocktail, Thermo Scientific, 78442), 5 mM DTT, in the presence of GIPC1-HIS8x over night at 4 /C14 C. The supernatant was collected and the beads were washed 3 times with binding buffer. Next, the beads were boiled for 5 min in 6x sample buffer with 10 % BMEandloaded for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described above. Both pellet and supernatant fractions were analyzed by Coomassie staining (Bulldog Bio) and western blotting.

To identify SH3BP4 binding partners, FLAG-influenza-virus hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged SH3BP4 was overexpressed in HEK cells using standard Calcium phosphate and polyethylenimine (PEI) methods as described above. Cells were harvested the next day and washed once with ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl, 1 % NP40, protease inhibitor cocktail as described above at 4 /C14 Cfor at least 30 min. Lysates were sonicated for three times 10 seconds at 20 % amplitude and lysates were pelleted. Supernatants were recovered and cleared through spin filters (0.45 m M pore size, PVDF, Millipore

#UFC40HV00) at 3000 g for 1 min at 4 /C14 C. Filtered cell lysates were pooled and mouse anti-HA tag antibody coated agarose beads were added (Sigma, #A2095) and incubated overnight rotating at 4 /C14 C. Then samples were washed seven times with lysis buffer and five more times with cold PBS. Proteins were eluted with 250 m g/ml HA peptide in PBS (Sigma, I2149) for three times. From the pooled eluted protein, 10 % were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses (PAGE) and silver staining (Thermo scientific, 24612) to verify expression and pull-down of the protein of interest. Peptides were then precipitated with 20 % trichloroacetic acid (TCA, Sigma) on ice for 30 min. Samples were spun in a tabletop centrifuge (Eppendorf) at max speed for 25 min at 4 /C14 C. Next, pellets were washed once with 10 % TCA and spun down again. The samples were washed three rounds with 1 ml of -20 /C14 Ccoldacetone (Sigma) and spun for 25 min at 4 /C14 C. The supernatant was aspirated and samples were air dried at room temperature and frozen at -80 /C14 C until use for mass spectrometry analysis.

For phosphoprotein analysis, FLAG-HA-SH3BP4 was expressed as described above and cells were harvested in lysis buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors 1 mM Sodium, 1 mM Sodium orthovanadate 1 mM Sodium pyrophosphate decahydrate 1 mM b -Glycerophosphate disodium salt hydrate as outlined above. After peptide elution samples were boiled 5 min with corresponding volume of 6x sample buffer (with BME) and loaded for PAGE. The gel was stained using Coomassie stain and destain solutions (Bio-Rad, 1610435) and washed in water. The stained SH3BP4 band was cut and excised gel bands were reduced into approximately 1 mm 3 pieces. Gel pieces were then subjected to a modified in-gel trypsin digestion procedure (Shevchenko et al., 1996). Gel pieces were washed and dehydrated with acetonitrile for 10 min followed by removal of acetonitrile. Pieces were then completely dried in a speed-vac. Rehydration of the gel pieces was with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution containing 12.5 ng/ m l modified sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at 4 /C14 C. After 45 min, the excess trypsin solution was removed and replaced with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution to just cover the gel pieces. Samples were then placed in a 37 /C14 Croom overnight. Peptides were later extracted by removing the ammonium bicarbonate solution, followed by one wash with a solution containing 50 % acetonitrile and 1 % formic acid. The extracts were then dried in a speed-vac ( /C24 1 h). The samples were stored at 4 /C14 C until analysis. On the day of analysis, the samples were reconstituted in 5-10 m l of HPLC solvent A (2.5 % acetonitrile, 0.1 % formic acid). A nanoscale reverse-phase HPLC capillary column was created by packing 2.6 m mC18 spherical silica beads into a fused silica capillary (100 m minner diameter x /C24 30 cm length) with a flame-drawn tip (Peng and Gygi, 2001). After equilibrating the column each sample was loaded via a Famos auto sampler (LC Packings, San Francisco CA) onto the column. A gradient was formed and peptides were eluted with increasing concentrations of solvent B (97.5 % acetonitrile, 0.1 % formic acid). As peptides eluted, they were subjected to electrospray ionization and then entered into an LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro ion-trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Peptides were detected, isolated, and fragmented to produce a tandem mass spectrum of specific fragment ions for each peptide. Peptide sequences (and hence protein identity) were determined by matching protein databases with the acquired fragmentation pattern by the software program, Sequest (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA)(Eng et al., 1994). All databases include a reversed version of all the sequences and the data were filtered to between a one and two percent peptide false discovery rate.

To remove contaminating false positive proteins, control samples were generated. The pcDNA FLAG-HA empty vector was expressed in HEK cells and samples were processed the same way as described above for SH3BP4. The experiment was repeated twice and the resulting list of recurrent contaminants was subtracted from the data. Next, proteins were included in the final list that exhibited at least three peptides in three independent experiments (see Table S5). For Figure 4A only proteins identified with at least ten peptides in each of three independent experiments were displayed to enhance readability of the figure. Phospho-peptides were evaluated using the Ascor algorithm where localization was considered confidently assigned with scores above 19 (Beausoleil et al., 2006). Listed are all phosphorylated SH3BP4 peptides that were detected in four independent experiments (Lu et al., 2014) (Table S1).

To quantify the endocytosis of a 5-integrins a cell surface biotinylation and uptake assay was used as previously described (Valdembri et al., 2009). Two million RPE cells were seeded per 10 cm dish and grown over night as described above. The next day, cells were starved in serum free low glucose DMEM medium (Gibco, 11885-084) for 9 h. The conditioned medium was collected and cells were washed once in ice cold PBS and biotin- labeled in 10 ml of PBS containing 0.2 mg/ml EZ link sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Thermo, 21331) or HOOK-sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (G-Biosciences, BG-09) for 30 min at 4 /C14 C in the cold room. Cells were washed once with ice cold PBS. The conditioned medium was added back and cells were placed at 37 /C14 C in a cell culture incubator for receptor internalization. At the indicated timepoints, cells were washed twice with ice cold PBS and stored in PBS. Except for the total surface protein control sample, the PBS was removed and non-internalized biotin was cleaved for 1 h at 4 /C14 C in the cold room by adding 10 ml of cleavage buffer containing 20 mM sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (MesNA, Sigma, M1511) in 50 mM Tris-HCl (Fisher Scientific, pH 8.6) and 100 mM NaCl (RPI). The cleavage reaction was quenched by 400 m l of 0.5 M Iodoacetamide (Sigma, I1149) in PBS for 10 min at 4 /C14 C. Cells were washed twice in PBS, cells were harvested by scraping and spun down in a table top centrifuge at 4 /C14 C. Cells were lysed in 1 ml of buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 % NP40, protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 1 mMSodiumOrthovanadate (Fisher Scientific, ICN15966425) and 2 mM MgCl2 (Fisher Scientific) for 1 h at 4 /C14 Crotating. Cell lysates were spun down and supernatants were collected. For the western blot analysis of the supernatant, before addition of antibody, 50 m l of supernatant was collected and stored at 4 /C14 C. To the remaining cell lysate, for immune-precipitation of a 5-integrin, antibodies against total a 5-integrin (Biolegend, 328002, NKI-SAM-1, mouse, 2 m g per sample), inactive a 5-integrin (Millipore, MABT822, mAb11, rat, 2 m g per sample) or active a 5-integrin (Millipore, SNAKA51, MABT201, mouse, 4 m g per sample) and 30 m l of ProteinG-agarose (ABT) were added and samples were rotated overnight at 4 /C14 C. The next day, beads were collected and washed three times with lysis buffer. The liquid was removed from the beads and 20 m l of 6x sample buffer (w/o BME) were added and samples were heated at 95 /C14 C for 5 min. Samples were loaded on 10 % polyacrylamide gels and blotted on PVDF membrane and blocked

To assess the effect of semaphorin-3a on Akt phosphorylation, 500 K RPE wt or SH3BP4 KO cells were seeded in 10 cm culture dishes and starved overnight in low glucose serum free medium (Gibco). To the conditioned medium, 10 m g/ml purified HIS6xSEMA3A was added and incubated for 1 h at 37 /C14 C. Cells were washed once with PBS and collected with a cell scraper and spun down in a table top centrifuge. Cells were resuspended in 50 m l of lysis buffer with 50 mM Tris (Fisher Scientific), pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl (RPI), 0.5 % NP40 (Fluka) and HALT Protease and Phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific). Cell lysates were spun down at top speed and 6x sample buffer containing 10 % BME was added to samples before they were processed for western blotting for Akt phosphorylated at Ser473 (rabbit, D9E, Cell Signaling Technology, 4060). Blots were imaged and analyzed as described above using Image studio light (Li-Cor). The pS473 signal was normalized with the total Akt signal. Data are shown as mean and standard error and samples were compared using Student's t test.

## Live cell microscopy and analysis

For total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy experiments where protein targeting to clathrin coated pits (CCPs) was measured, a clathrin light chain-a(Clca)-tdTomato fusion was used as marker for CCPs. Cells were infected with adenovirus expressing tdTomato-Clca fusion protein and tTA helper adenovirus as previously described (Hardy et al., 1997, Altschuler et al., 1998) 24 h before imaging. Cover glasses were mounted on custom built chambers for microscopy. For experiments with semaphorin-3a (SEMA3A) treatment, 10 m g purified HIS6x-SEMA3A was added to 1 ml conditioned medium and cells were imaged during the first hour of treatment. Cells were imaged on a TI-eclipse inverted microscope with a perfect focus system (Nikon), a TIRF unit (Diskovery, Andor Technology, Concord, MA), an Apo TIRF 60x 1.49 NA objective (Nikon) and a 1.8x tube lens yielding 108x total magnification. The microscope contained 488 nm (150 mW), 561 nm (50 mW) and 642 nm (110 mW) solid state lasers, a dichroic filter (GFP/Rhodamine-x/Cy5 triple laser TIRF, 488/561/642, Chroma, C124324). The ultra-fast emission filter wheel (Applied Scientific Instrumentation, FW-1000), was equipped with emission band pass filters for 525 nm ± 25, 600 nm ± 25, 700 nm ± 37.5 (all Chroma) and images were acquired using a Zyla 4.2 sCMOS camera (Andor) with 6.5 micron pixel size. The system was controlled by Metamorph software (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA). The TIRF angle of the incident laser light was software controlled (Diskovery Control v1.2.0.0, Andor Technology) and set to 80 nm penetration depth. The temperature was maintained at 37 /C14 C by a Bold Line Cage incubator (Okolab, Italy). Images were acquired every 2 seconds for 150- 211 frames (or 5-7 min total movie duration). For long-term imaging of the effects of SEMA3A on SH3BP4-GFP targeting to CCPs, images were acquired every 10 seconds for 60 min. Imaging was started after the addition of SEMA3A. For analysis of Eps15-SNAP targeting to CCPs, cells were stained with 3 m M SNAP-cell647-SiR dye (NEB, S9102S) for 20 min at 37 /C14 C in the incubator, according to manufacturer's instructions. To remove excess dye, cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated in fresh medium for at least 20 more min prior to imaging to further wash out membrane associated SNAP dye. Cells were then mounted for TIRF imaging as outlined above.

For the quantification of protein recruitment to bona-fide CCPs we used the cmeAnalysis software as previously described (Aguet et al., 2013, Srinivasan et al., 2018) (software available at https://github.com/DanuserLab/cmeAnalysis ). In brief, significant diffraction limited clathrin structures were detected by a Gaussian-fit approach for each timepoint and structures were linked over time using uTrack (Jaqaman et al., 2008), which is included in cmeAnalysis. The post-processing of the CCP tracks included gap closing, dissection of compound tracks and removal of bright cytoplasmic visitor structures as described (Aguet et al., 2013). Next, bona-fide CCPs were selected by manually setting an intensity threshold for the clathrin signal to be reached within the first 6 frames (12 seconds) of the CCP lifetime as described (Srinivasan et al., 2018). The threshold was set for the control conditions such that the lifetime distribution peaked around 30-40 seconds and the dominant contribution of short-lived structures with lifetimes shorter than 20 seconds was eliminated. This reduced the proportion of short lived (10-30 sec) and likely abortive CCPs that likely do not lead to productive endocytic events. The same intensity threshold was applied to pooled datasets (data acquired on multiple days) and across conditions within one experiment. To measure SH3BP4-GFP signal intensities at CCPs the ''master-slave'' approach was used as described previously (Aguet et al., 2013, Mettlen et al., 2010). Intensities in both channels were corrected by local background values (Aguet et al., 2013). This yielded SH3BP4-GFP intensities at individual CCPs along their entire lifetime. CCPs that were significantly SH3BP4-GFP positive in at least one single frame were selected for further analysis. Next, CCPs with similar duration were pooled in lifetime cohorts (Loerke et al., 2011), yielding average intensities per cohort. To facilitate the data interpretation, only the 40-60 second cohort was printed in the figure panels. Mean and standard error (SEM) are shown for the intensity cohorts. To compare different experimental conditions, mean SH3BP4-GFP intensities for each movie were calculated as described (Srinivasan et al., 2018). Differences between conditions were assessed by rank-sum tests (see above). For some experiments, the fraction of continuously positive CCPs was analyzed, where the GFP signal was required to be significantly positive in all frames along a CCP track. For both mean GFP intensity and continuously positive CCPs the data from all cohorts were analyzed. In order to benchmark the software, constructs that were not expected to be efficiently targeted to CCPs (cytosolic GFP, membrane-GFP) were used as negative controls and bona fide CME accessory factors Eps15-GFP and Dyn2-GFP were used as positive controls for CCP targeting.

was repeated at least three times with approximately 10-20 movies per condition per day, with on average one cell per movie. Data acquired independently on at least three days was pooled for the analysis. This yielded around 30-60 movies per condition. Control data were acquired on all days to account for day-to-day and cell-to-cell variability. Individual CCP intensity traces were plotted from the results generated by cmeAnalysis software as described earlier (Srinivasan et al., 2018). Rank-sum statistical test was used to compare conditions.

## Cell based assays

For the antibody uptake assay, cells were seeded on 18 mm round cover glasses #1.5 (Warner Instruments, CS18R15) and starved overnight in low glucose and serum free DMEM medium (1 g/L D-glucose, Gibco, 11885-084). The next day cells were washed once with PBS containing 1 mM MgCl2 (Fisher Scientific, BP214), 1 mM CaCl2 (Fisher Scientific, BP510) and 0.2 % BSA (PBS3+) and incubated with 50 m g/ml neuropilin-1 (mouse, BioLegend, 354502) or a 5-integrin (mouse BioLegend, NKI-SAM-1, 328002) antibodies in PBS3+for 10 min in the cold (for neuropilin antibody only, to increase the amount of antibody taken up by the cells) followed by 30 min at 37 /C14 C. Cells were put on ice and washed once with PBS3+ followed by three acid washes (200 mM acetic acid, 200 mM NaCl, pH 2.3) and three more washes with PBS3+, all at 4 /C14 C. Cells were then fixed in 4 % PFA on ice for 10 min and another 10 min at room temperature. Samples were permeabilized with Triton X-100 and washed as described above and stained with secondary antimouse-AlexaFluor-647 (Thermo Scientific, A31571), phalloidin-AlexaFluor-488 (Thermo), and 4 0 ,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma, D9542) for 15 min at 4 /C14 C. Samples were washed again and mounted in Fluoromount aqueous mounting medium (Sigma, F4680) and dried at room temperature. Stained cells were imaged on an inverted epifluorescent microscope (Nikon, eclipse-Ti-U) equipped with a Plan Apo l 100x, N.A. 1.45 objective (Nikon), a Lambda-XL light source and Lambda 10-B smart shutter (both Sutter Instruments), a Zyla sCMOS camera (Andor) and controlled by m Manager (NIH) (Edelstein et al., 2010). For each condition 30-35 images were acquired encompassing approximately 1-5 cells each. Plotted are average values per image (i.e. one datapoint per image). Antibody and DAPI images were segmented using Squash (ImageJ suite from the Ivo Sbalzarini lab, MPI-Dresden, Germany, http://mosaic.mpi-cbg.de/?q=downloads/imageJ ) (Rizk et al., 2014). The segmentation parameter ''regularization'' was set to 0.05 for all images and the parameter ''minimum object intensity'' was set to 0.25 for antibody signal, while it was set to 0.15 for the DAPI signal. The results of the segmentation were analyzed in Matlab. In brief, for each image, the number of cells was determined based on the number of segmented nuclei and the fluorescence intensity from the segmented antibody signal was summed and averaged per cell. For statistical analysis the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon rank sum test was used. The number of experimental repeats is indicated in the figure legend, one data from a representative experiment is shown.

To assess the spreading efficiency of RPE cells, 22 mm square #1.5 cover glasses (Corning, 2850-22) in 6-well plates were coated with 2 ml of 10 m g/ml fibronectin solution in PBS (Sigma, F1141) for 30 min at 37 /C14 C. Cells were seeded at 10 K per well in DMEM with 10 % FBS and AA for 20 min before they were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA, Sigma, P6148) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were washed and cells permeabilized in PBS containing 0.5 % Triton-X100 (Fisher Scientific, BP151) for 5 min at room temperature. After three additional PBS washes, samples were stained with primary antibodies for paxillin (rabbit, Y113, Abcam, ab32084) and active a 5-integrin (clone SNAKA51, mouse, Millipore, MABT201) for 1 h at 4 /C14 Cin 1 % BSA in PBS. The antibody SNAKA51 recognizes the active conformation of a 5-integrins (Clark et al., 2005). After washing, cells were incubated with fluorescently tagged secondary antibodies donkey anti-mouse-AlexaFluor-647 (Thermo Scientific, A31571), donkey anti-rabbit-AlexaFluor-568 (Thermo Scientific, A10042) and phalloidin-AlexaFluor-488 (Thermo Scientific, A12381) in 1 % BSA in PBS. Cells were washed, fixed again with 4 % PFA solution, washed again, mounted for TIRF microscopy and imaged as described above. For area measurements, cells were outlined manually in the actin channel using ImageJ and data were analyzed with Matlab. Adhesions in the paxillin and active a 5-integrin images were segmented using Squash/ImageJ as described above. For the segmentation, the parameter ''regularization'' was set to 0.05, and ''minimum object intensity'' was set to 0.25 for both the paxillin and the activea 5integrin signal. Experiments were repeated at least three times, data from one representative experiment is shown. For each condition around 30-35 image stacks were acquired, each containing one cell (i.e. one data point representing one cell).

To quantify the fibronectin fibrils, RPE and endothelial HMEC1 cells were seeded at 10 K cells per 6 well plate on 22 mm square #1.5 cover glass (Corning) in full medium for 3 h. Cells were fixed with 4 % PFA (see above) and stained with antibodies against fibronectin (Abcam, ab2413, rabbit) and total a 5-integrin (Biolegend, 328002, clone NKI-SAM-1, mouse) for 1 h at 4 /C14 C. Cells were washed three times with PBS and stained with fluorescently tagged secondary antibodies donkey anti-mouse-AlexaFluor-647 (Thermo Scientific, A31571) and donkey anti-rabbit-AlexaFluor-568 (Thermo Scientific, A10042) for 15 min at 4 /C14 C. Cells were washed three times and post-fixed with 4 % PFA for 10 min before they were washed and mounted for TIRF microscopy. For each condition 50 images with one or more cells were acquired and the cells were manually classified for fibronectin fibrils. Experiments were repeated three times. Data are presented as mean and standard error and conditions were compared using Student's t test.

To test the role of SH3BP4 in SEMA3A signaling, the SEMA3A cell area contraction assay was adapted from Takahashi et al. (Takahashi et al., 1999). In brief, cells were seeded in 12 well plastic dishes (Falcon, 353225) coated with attachment factor solution (0.1 %gelatin, Gibco, S006100) and serum starved overnight as described above. The next day, 10 m g/ml purified HIS6x-SEMA3A was added to the conditioned medium and cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 /C14 C and fixed with 4 % PFA as described above. Fixed cells were imaged on a Nikon eclipse TS100 microscope with a 20x/ NA 0.40 Ph1 objective and a Retiga R3 CCD camera (Qimaging, Surrey, BC, Canada) with 4.54 m mpixel size, controlled by m Manager (NIH). For each condition 10-15 images were acquired, each containing approximately 10-20 cells. Cell outlines were manually generated in ImageJ (NIH) and analyzed and plotted in Matlab. For each condition 100 cell outlines were analyzed (i.e. one datapoint representing one cell). The Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon rank sum
