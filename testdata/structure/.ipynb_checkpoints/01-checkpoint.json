Burckhardt et al. report that SH3BP4 localization to clathrin-coated pits is regulated by Akt. Operating at the intersection of signaling and membrane trafficking, SH3BP4 mediates both internal and external cues to regulate the endocytosis of neuropilin and a 5-integrin receptors, thus modulating cell-matrix interactions.\n\n## SH3BP4 promotes neuropilin-1 and a 5-integrin endocytosis and is inhibited by Akt\n\n## SUMMARY\n\nCells probe their surrounding matrix for attachment sites via integrins that are internalized by endocytosis. We find that SH3BP4 regulates integrin surface expression in a signaling-dependent manner via clathrincoated pits (CCPs). Dephosphorylated SH3BP4 at S246 is efficiently recruited to CCPs, while upon Akt phosphorylation, SH3BP4 is sequestered by 14-3-3 adaptors and excluded from CCPs. In the absence of Akt activity, SH3BP4 binds GIPC1 and targets neuropilin-1 and a 5/ b 1-integrin for endocytosis, leading to inhibition of cell spreading. Similarly, chemorepellent semaphorin-3a binds neuropilin-1 to activate PTEN, which antagonizes Akt and thus recruits SH3BP4 to CCPs to internalize both receptors and induce cell contraction. In PTEN mutant non-small cell lung cancer cells with high Akt activity, expression of non-phosphorylatable active SH3BP4-S246A restores semaphorin-3a induced cell contraction. Thus, SH3BP4 links Akt signaling to endocytosis of NRP1 and a 5/ b 1-integrins to modulate cell-matrix interactions in response to intrinsic and extrinsic cues.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nSH3BP4(SH3binding protein 4, also known as transferrin receptor trafficking protein, TTP) was cloned from human corneal fibroblasts and was found to be ubiquitously expressed (Dunlevy et al., 1999). Subsequently, SH3BP4 was associated with cellular compartments such as the plasma membrane and the nucleus (Khanobdee et al., 2004), lysosomes (Kim et al., 2012), filopodia (O'Loughlin et al., 2018), the perinuclear region (Antas et al., 2019), endosomes (Francavilla et al., 2013) and clathrincoated pits (CCPs) (Tosoni et al., 2005), indicating that localization and function of SH3BP4 are still diffuse. The N-terminal portion of SH3BP4 contains binding motifs for clathrin, dynamin-2, and Eps15 and was shown to bind these proteins (Tosoni et al., 2005). This has suggested that SH3BP4 might be implicated in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME).\n\nCME is the primary process for macromolecular uptake in most cells (Conner and Schmid, 2003). AP-2 adaptor complexes and clathrin triskelia assemble a protein coat at the plasma membrane, together with more than 30 accessory factors (Schmid and McMahon, 2007). Transmembrane receptors are sorted into CCPs via AP-2 and other adaptors (Traub, 2009). CME accessory factors regulate AP-2 complexes, generate and sense membrane curvature, stabilize or destabilize the clathrin coat, and orchestrate the recruitment of cargo and the GTPase dynamin (Mettlen et al., 2018). A multitude of mostly weak and transient protein-protein and protein-phospholipid interactions keep coats adaptive to changing membrane curvatures (McMahon and Boucrot, 2011). At the late stages, the mechanochemical GTPase dynamin assembles around the membrane neck for membrane fission, releasing the coated vesicle (Antonny et al., 2016). Rapid phosphoinositide conversion triggers vesicle uncoating (He et al., 2017) and the vesicle and cargo enter endosomal sorting (Zerial and McBride, 2001).\n\nAmong the many cargos internalized via CME are integrin cellmatrix attachment receptors (Moreno-Layseca et al., 2019). Integrins form heterodimeric complexes composed of a and b chains that exist in ''closed,'' inactive and active, and ''open'' conformations to signal in a bidirectional way across the plasma membrane(Hynes,2002). Integrins connect the extracellular matrix (ECM) via adhesions to the actomyosin cytoskeleton (Schwartz,2010).Talin andkindlin inducethe high-affinity integrin conformation that promotes ECM binding, referred to as insideout signaling (Sun et al., 2019). Reciprocally, the abundance of integrin binding sites on ECM proteins leads to the formation of adhesion complexes, known as outside-in signaling (Kim et al., 2003).\n\nWhile integrin activation and assembly of adhesion complexes are well studied (Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009), it is less clear how integrins are inactivated. Protein complexes capturing the cytoplasmic portions of integrins are inducing the inactive conformation through inside-out-signaling (Bouvard et al.,\n\n2013). In addition, endocytosis is thought to play a major role in integrin homeostasis via the reduction of integrin exposure at the cell surface (Caswell et al., 2009). However, only a few interactions of bona fide CME accessory factors with integrins are established. A subset of a -integrin cytoplasmic tails interact with the m 2 subunit of the AP-2 complex (De Franceschi et al., 2016). The b -integrin tails bind through their NPxY motifs with protein-tyrosine binding domains in Dab2 (Teckchandani et al., 2009; Prunier and Howe, 2005) and Numb (Calderwood et al., 2003; Nishimura and Kaibuchi, 2007). Additionally, a number of non-CME proteins were reported to bind integrin tails (Caswell et al., 2009). Among them is GIPC1, a PDZ domain containing protein that targets neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and a 5 and a 6-integrins for endocytosis (Valdembri et al., 2009; Tani and Mercurio, 2001). However, it is not understood how GIPC1 connects with the CCP machinery. As with integrin activation, integrin endocytosis can also be triggered from outside e.g., by chemorepellents such as semaphorin-3a (Serini et al., 2003; Gioelli et al., 2018). The semaphorin ligands bind NRP1 receptors, which is thought to reduce Akt activity (Chadborn et al., 2006). Again, how these various signals impinge on the dynamics of endocytic integrin trafficking has remained elusive.\n\nHere, we establish SH3BP4 as a central link between such signals and integrin endocytosis. We show that dephosphorylated SH3BP4 is efficiently accumulating at CCPs and enhancing NRP1 and a 5-integrin endocytosis, thereby reducing cell adhesion. We also show that SH3BP4 endocytic activity is inhibited by Akt phosphorylation, and we establish the mechanism of both activation and inactivation of SH3BP4. We propose that under conditions of reduced Akt signaling, cell attachment is weakened by an SH3BP4-dependent endocytic process whereby integrins are internalized. We show how the Akt-regulated SH3BP4tiesNRP1stimulation by semaphorin ligands to the control of integrin endocytosis. Together, these data resolve numerous open questions regarding the integration of cellintrinsic and extrinsic signals and adhesion regulation.\n",

            "content": "We chose to study the subcellular localization of the protein product of SH3BP4 in human hTERT immortalized retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells (Jiang et al., 1999), since SH3BP4 expression was reported to be high in ocular tissues (Dunlevy et al., 1999). We used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate SH3BP4 knockout cells and expressed the SH3BP4-GFP fusion by lentiviral transduction (Figure 1A). We applied live cell total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to quantify the accumulation of SH3BP4-GFP at CCPs that were labeled by tdTomato-clathrin light chain a (Clca) (Figure 1B). The tdTomato-Clca signals were detected and tracked as previously described (Aguet et al., 2013) (Figures S1A-S1E) and the SH3BP4-GFP signal at CCPs was followed over time (Figures 1CandS1F). For comparison, cytosolic and membrane-targeted GFPwererecorded (Figure S1G). SH3BP4-GFP did not accumulate at CCPs (Figures 1B-1D and S1H-S1I), contrary to the bona fide CME accessory factors Eps15 and dynamin-2 (Dyn2) (Figure 1C) (Taylor et al., 2011). For both Eps15 and Dyn2, more CCPs were GFP positive (Figure 1D), had higher mean GFP intensity (Figure S1H), and showed more continuously positive CCPs than SH3BP4 (Figure S1I). This opened the possibility that the SH3BP4 presence at CCPs was regulated by additional mechanisms.\n\nIndeed, by mass spectrometry, we found multiple phosphorylation sites, with serine-246 (S246) as the most phosphorylated residue (Figures 1E, S1J, and S1K; Table S1). To test how the phosphorylation status affected targeting of SH3BP4-GFP to CCPs, we mutated some of the most frequently observed phosphorylation sites (Table S1) to non-phosphorylatable alanine (A) or phosphomimic aspartic acid (D) residues and quantified SH3BP4-GFP accumulation at CCPs (Figures 1F and S1L). Most prominently, S246A and S246D exhibited enhanced colocalization with CCPs. This site was previously reported to be susceptible to Akt phosphorylation (Chiba et al., 2009; Reinartz et al., 2014) and fits an RxKRxxS Akt phosphorylation motif (Figure S1M; Table S2) (Manning and Cantley, 2007). Moreover, reports suggest that for Akt phosphorylation sites, aspartic and glutamic acid residues do not function as phosphomimic toward 14-3-3 adaptor binding (Yip-Schneider et al., 2000) (examples in Table S3; Figure 2A), explaining why both mutants exhibited the same phenotype. Next, we asked to what extent the recruitment of non-phosphorylatable SH3BP4-GFP S246A was dependent on CME peptide motifs (Tosoni et al., 2005). Specifically, we mutated the clathrin binding motif (LIDL), the Dyn2 specific SH3domain, and the Eps15-homology domain binding NPF motifs (SH3BP4-delta-CME, dCME). By reconstitution of the S246A/dCME mutants in the RPE SH3BP4 KO cells, we confirmed strong colocalization of the S246A construct with CCPs but reduced colocalization by S246A/dCME (Figures 1G and 1H). This suggested a contribution of the CME motifs to CCP targeting. Intensity profiles of individual CCPs indicated that the SH3BP4-GFP S246A localized to CCPs along their\n\nlifetime (Figure 1I). The S246A mutant also showed more continuously positive CCPs (Figure 1J) and higher mean SH3BP4-GFP intensity at CCPs (Figures 1K, 1L, and S1N). The efficient localization of S246A to CCPs was also apparent in a different RPE cell line and in a human microvascular endothelial cell line (Figures S1OandS1T), implying that this observation can be generalized. In summary, these data suggest that the phosphorylation status at S246 regulates the incorporation of SH3BP4 into CCPs."

            "content": "Our data indicated that phosphorylated SH3BP4 was blocked from CCP accumulation, so we sought to elucidate the mechanism of SH3BP4 inhibition. It was previously reported that SH3BP4 binds 14-3-3 adaptor proteins via phosphorylated S246 (Chiba et al., 2009) and the amino acid sequence\n\nRSKRSYpSL around pS246 overlaps with 14-3-3 consensus binding motifs (Yaffe et al., 1997) where the phospho-group is captured by 14-3-3 (Muslin et al., 1996). Indeed, all isoforms of 14-3-3 bound SH3BP4 (Figures S2A and S2B). To confirm the interaction of SH3BP4 with the 14-3-3 \u03b5 isoform, we overexpressed SH3BP4-GFP and probed for binding of endogenous 14-3-3 \u03b5 (Figures 2A, S2C, and S2D). Consistent with previous findings, the non-phosphorylatable S246A mutant did not bind 14-3-3 \u03b5 (Chiba et al., 2009). To further study the putative loss of function caused by the interaction with 14-3-3, we introduced into SH3BP4 a 20-amino-acid peptide R18, which constitutively binds 14-3-3 (Wang et al., 1999) (Table S4). The R18 peptide was introduced upstream of S246 where it replaced a stretch of less conservedaminoacidsinSH3BP4(FigureS2E).Asexpected, SH3BP4-GFP R18 pulled down endogenous 14-3-3 \u03b5 efficiently,\n\nwhile the mutant R18-KK peptide did not (Figures 2B and S2F). The S246A/R18 construct with only one 14-3-3 binding site, showed reduced 14-3-3 \u03b5 binding in accordance with a model where multiple 14-3-3 binding sites enhanced the interaction with the dimeric 14-3-3 adaptors (Yaffe, 2002). This notion was further supported with an SH3BP4 construct containing two R18 sites that more strongly bound 14-3-3 \u03b5 (Figures S2G and S2H).\n\nWe then tested the effect of R18-mediated 14-3-3 binding on SH3BP4 targeting to CCPs. The S246/R18 construct, where 143-3 proteins could bind both a phosphorylated S246 and the R18 peptide, was efficiently excluded form CCPs (Figures 2C, 2D, and S2I). The construct S246A/R18 where 14-3-3 only bound once at the peptide sequence was found at CCPs as frequently as the wt protein, and the S246A/R18-KK mutant was recruited to CCPsasefficientlyastheS246Amutant,consistentwithabolished 14-3-3 binding. These data suggested that 14-3-3 binding to the SH3BP4pS246sitestronglyinhibitedtheincorporationintoCCPs.\n\nPrevious studies had identified Akt as the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of S246 (Chiba et al., 2009; Reinartz et al., 2014). Indeed, Akt1 overexpression enhanced 14-3-3 \u03b5 binding to SH3BP4-GFP (Figures 2E and S2J). Conversely, the 14-33 b -GFP fusion protein showed enhanced SH3BP4 binding under Akt overexpression (Figures 2F and S2K). Together, these data support a model in which SH3BP4 phosphorylation by Akt at S246 promotes 14-3-3 binding, which sequesters SH3BP4 preventing its recruitment to CCPs. This establishes SH3BP4 as an Akt substrate in CME."

            "content": "Next, we explored the nature of SH3BP4 targeting to CCPs and the mechanism of inhibition by 14-3-3. When combined with the S246A activating mutation, all of SH3BP4's single CME motif mutants reduced CCP targeting compared with the S246A mutation alone (Figures 3A and S3A). This suggested that for efficient incorporation of SH3BP4 into the CCP structure, concerted interactions with clathrin heavy chain (CHC), Eps15, and Dyn2 were needed. In vitro , Eps15 bound most SH3BP4, followed by Dyn2 and CHC (Figures 3B and S3B). The interaction of Eps15 and Dyn2 with SH3BP4 was reduced by the dCME mutation and binding was comparable with interactions with well-established CME partners of Eps15 and Dyn2 (Figures S3C-S3J), as reported before (Tosoni et al., 2005; Salcini et al., 1997). Comparison of SH3BP4-GFP S246A recruitment (Figure 1K) with profiles of Eps15 and Dyn2 (Figure 1C) suggested a better match with Eps15 (Mettlen et al., 2018; Taylor et al., 2011). Moreover, in presence of 14-3-3, the Eps15-SH3BP4 interaction was weakened (Figures 3C and S3K). Since the most proximal Eps15- homology domain interaction motif (NPF) is only eight amino acids upstream of S246, an interference by 14-3-3 is conceivable (Figure S2E). Consistent with this notion and our model of SH3BP4 as a substrate for Akt, overexpression of Akt reduced Eps15 binding to SH3BP4 (Figures 3D and S3L). We further tested if SH3BP4-GFP wt and S246A positive CCPs were simultaneously positive for Eps15. Indeed, some CCPs showed a synchronized accumulation of both SH3BP4-GFP S246A and Eps15-SNAP (Figures 3E, 3F, 3M, and S3A). On average, the amount of SH3BP4/Eps15 double-positive CCPs increased with S246A (Figures 3G and S3N-S3Q) despite the fact that SH3BP4 S246A expression levels were lower than for the wt protein in these cells (Figure S3M). Together, these data indicate that Eps15 contributes to SH3BP4 recruitment to CCPs and that this interaction is antagonized by 14-3-3 binding when SH3BP4 is phosphorylated at S246 by Akt."

            "subtitle": "## SH3BP4 binds GIPC1",
            "content": "To better understand the function of SH3BP4 at CCPs, we performed mass spectrometry to identify binding partners (Figures 4A and S4A; Table S5). As expected, these analyses indicated 14-3-3 isoforms, together with a few other reproducible binding partners, such as GIPC1. GIPC family proteins, of which there are three isoforms, are 37-kDa adaptors with a PDZ domain that binds to three-amino-acid-long motifs found at the C terminus of particular transmembrane receptors (Katoh, 2013), myosin-6 (Bunn et al., 1999), and APPL proteins (Varsano et al., 2006; Lin et al., 2006) (Schenck et al., 2008). SH3BP4 has previously been identified as a GIPC1 binding partner by high throughput proteomics, but this interaction was not further explored (Ewing et al., 2007) (O'Loughlin et al., 2018). Indeed, when we used GIPC1 as a bait, SH3BP4 was one of the strongest hits (Figure S4A; Table S5). Furthermore, endogenous GIPC1 co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous SH3BP4 (Figures 4B and S4B). SH3BP4 binding was specific to GIPC isoform 1 (Figures 4C and S4C). GIPC and SH3BP4 interact directly as shown by pull-down experiments with purified, recombinant GIPC1 with SH3BP4 (Figures 4D, S4D, and S4E). GIPC1 with mutant PDZ domain (Giese et al., 2012) showed enhanced SH3BP4 interaction (Figures 4E and S4F), confirming that SH3BP4didnot interact via the GIPC PDZ domain. To determine the domain of GIPC1-mediating interaction with SH3BP4 a series of GIPC1 fragments were tested for their ability to pull down SH3BP4 (Figure 4F). The C-terminal region without the PDZ domain showed enhanced binding to SH3BP4, suggesting intramolecular inhibition could shield the GIPC1 C-term (Figures 4G and S4G). Next, a series of N-terminal and C-terminal SH3BP4 fragments were tested for GIPC1 binding (Figures 4H-4J and S4H) and a middle region of SH3BP4 containing the S246 site emerged as the most likely binding domain (fragmentq, Figures 4K and S4H). Therefore, we tested whether binding to GIPC is also regulated by SH3BP4 phosphorylation in cell lysates and found that S246A pulled down GIPC1 more efficiently than wt (Figures 4L and S4I). When the SH3BP4-GIPC1 interaction was challenged with 14-3-3 on the R18 mutant constructs, GIPC1 pull down was reduced, although to a lesser extent than that observed in Eps15 (Figures 4L and S4I). Together, these data establish a GIPC1 and SH3BP4 interaction, which is sensitive to competition by 14-3-3 adaptors."

            "subtitle": "## SH3BP4 regulates neuropilin-1 and a 5-integrin endocytosis",
            "content": "Next, we explored whether SH3BP4 is involved in the endocytosis of transmembrane proteins that are known to bind GIPC1. GIPC1 binds via its PDZ domain the cytoplasmic tail of neuropilin-1 (NRP1) (Cai and Reed, 1999), a 5 and a 6-integrin (Tani and Mercurio, 2001; Mourabit et al., 2002). The GIPC1 PDZ domain binds the highly conserved C-terminal SEA* motif of the NRP1 cytoplasmic tail (Figure S5A; Table S2). GIPC1 was reported to mediate NRP1 endocytosis in human endothelial cells (Valdembri et al., 2009), and this function is conserved in\n\nXenopus laevis where XGIPC was also found to regulate a 5/ b 1 integrin endocytosis (Spicer et al., 2010). Furthermore, NRP1 neither has a conserved NPxY nor a Yxx \u0278 motif, which would promote interactions with the Dab2/Numb and AP-2 adaptors, respectively (De Franceschi et al., 2016). This suggests GIPC1 could play an important role in NRP1 internalization (Figure S4A; Table S5) (Pang et al., 2014). However, it is not clear how GIPC1 is targeted to CCPs. To explore whether SH3BP4 could form a complex with GIPC1 and NRP1 simultaneously, the cytoplasmic portion of NRP1 was fused to GFP and the fusion bound GIPC, indeed. Interestingly, binding was increased /C24 2-fold in the presence of SH3BP4 (Figures 5A and S5B), but SH3BP4 did not bind NRP1 in the absence of GIPC1 (Figure 5A). While the dCME mutation had no effect on the formation of the NRP1/GIPC1/ SH3BP4 complex, the S246A mutation enhanced the incorporation of both GIPC1 and SH3BP4 (Figures 5B and S5C), suggesting that SH3BP4 phosphorylation at S246 impaired GIPC1/ NRP1 binding. Further supporting these findings, SH3BP4-R18 was only poorly pulled down by GFP-NRP1 (Figures 5C and S5D). Moreover, GFP-NRP1 pulled down less GIPC1 and SH3BP4 under Akt overexpression (Figures 5D and S5E). Together, these data suggested that the interaction of GIPC1 with the NRP1 cytoplasmic portion was enhanced by SH3BP4, but inhibited by 14-3-3 adaptors, further highlighting the importance of the Akt phosphorylation.\n\nTo test whether SH3BP4 was mediating NRP1 endocytosis, weestablished an anti-NRP1 antibody-uptake assay in RPE cells that were serum starved for 12 h, to suppress Akt activity (Figures 5E and S5F). In RPE NRP1 KO cells no antibody was internalized, while reconstitution with GFP-NRP1 in the NRP1 KO cells significantly increased antibody internalization (Figures S5GandS5H). Knockdown of CHC by siRNA reduced NRP1 uptake, suggesting a CME-dependent uptake mechanism (Figures S5I and S5J). Both in RPE GIPC1 KO and in SH3BP4 KO cells (Figure 5F), NRP1 internalization was reduced (Figure 5G). When the SH3BP4 KO cells were reconstituted with SH3BP4 GFP mutants, both wt and S246A restored NRP1 uptake in starved cells, while dCME did not (Figure 5H). This supported a model where SH3BP4 together with GIPC1 were mediating NRP1 internalization by CME.\n\nLike NRP1, the a 5-integrin cytoplasmic domain has a highly conserved C-terminal S[D/E]A* motif that binds the GIPC1 PDZ domain (Figure S5K; Table S2) (Tani and Mercurio, 2001). To test whether SH3BP4 was involved in a 5-integrin endocytosis, we measured the uptake of an antibody against a 5-integrin in RPE cells (Figures S5L and S5M). The a 5-integrin uptake was strongly reduced in GIPC1 KO cells and restored with HIS8xGIPC1 reconstitution (Figures S5N-S5P). Similarly, a 5-integrin uptake was strongly reduced in SH3BP4 KO cells and restored\n\nupon reconstitution with either SH3BP4-GFP wt or S246A but only partially rescued by the dCME mutant (Figures 5I and S5Q-S5S). Finally, in RPE cells overexpressing constitutively active Akt, a 5-integrin uptake was partially inhibited (Figures 5J and S5T). Knockdown of CHC reduced a 5-integrin internalization (Figures S5I and S5U). Finally, in a biochemical uptake assay, SH3BP4 mediated internalization was not specific toward active or inactive a 5-integrins (Figures 5K-5M and S6A-S6C). As previously reported, GIPC1 was not specific for a a 5-integrin subpopulation (Figures S6D-S6G), while NRP1 was required for the uptake of active a 5-integrin (Figures S6H-S6K) (Valdembri et al., 2009). In summary, these data show that SH3BP4 does form a complex with the NRP1 C-term and GIPC1 that is sensitive to Akt phosphorylation and that both NRP1 and a 5-integrin endocytosis are dependent on SH3BP4."

Cells overexpressing SH3BP4-GFP wt and S246A exhibited reduced total a 5-integrin surface expression when analyzed by flow cytometry (Figure 6A). Next, the active a 5-integrin surface expression on fibronectin-coated glass was measured (Humphries, 2009). SH3BP4 KO cells spread out to cover 70% more area than wt cells and exhibited more active a 5-integrin (Figures 6B, 6C, and S6L). These effects were reversed by reconstitution of KO cells with wt SH3BP4-GFP. Importantly, the cell area was reduced by 52% in cells reconstituted with SH3BP4 S246A compared with cells reconstituted with wt SH3BP4-GFP (Figure 6C). Expression of SH3BP4 S246A also reduced active a 5-integrin (Figures 6B and 6C). To test whether the S246A inhibitory activity on spreading and active a 5-integrins depended on GIPC1 and/or NRP1, the corresponding KO cells were analyzed with overexpression of S246A (Figures 6D and S6M). Expression of S246A had no effect on GIPC1 KO cell spreading or surface expression of active a 5-integrins, suggesting that GIPC1 was required for the S246A activity. In contrast, in NRP1 KO cells, S246A expression reduced spreading as in wt cells, suggesting that SH3BP4 inhibition of spreading was not dependent on NRP1. Active a 5/ b 1-integrins bind soluble fibronectin dimers and mediate the assembly of fibronectin fibrils (Mao and Schwarzbauer, 2005). Fibronectin matrix secretion and remodeling is a core functionality of fibroblasts, but it is also observed for endothelial cells. Human RPE cells display both epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics (Gan et al., 2016), and they formed networks of fibronectin fibrils (Figure 6E). In the absence of GIPC1 or SH3BP4, fewer cells displayed fibronectin fibrils and the remaining fibrils were shorter (Figures 6E and 6F), while NRP1 KO cells remained competent\n\nfor fibril assembly. In SH3BP4 KO cells, the fibril formation was rescued by expression of SH3BP4-GFP wt or S246A mutant (Figure 6G). In human endothelial HMEC1 cells, SH3BP4 knockout also reduced fibronectin fibrillogenesis (Figures S6NS6P), suggesting that the process of matrix remodeling is dependent on SH3BP4 across cell types. Together, these results support a model where SH3BP4 coordinated with GIPC1 regulates a 5-integrin surface expression and fibronectin extracellular matrix remodeling."

            "content": "NRP1 has been reported as a co-receptor for a variety of transmembrane proteins and as a receptor for a series of ligands, including the chemorepellent semaphorin-3a (SEMA3A) (Lampropoulou and Ruhrberg, 2014). SEMA3A binds NRP1 (He and Tessier-Lavigne, 1997; Kolodkin et al., 1997) leading to complex formation with Plexin-A receptors (PlexinA1-4) (Takahashi et al., 1999; Tamagnone et al., 1999), which are GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) for Rap GTPases (Wang et al., 2012). Evidence is accumulating that endocytosis is required for SEMA3A-induced cell collapse (Jurney et al., 2002; Castellani et al., 2004; Fournier et al., 2000; Tojima et al., 2010; Gioelli et al., 2018). In addition, NRP1 was shown to increase active a 5/ b 1-integrin endocytosis in a GIPC1 dependent manner (Valdembri et al., 2009) and SEMA3A stimulated active a 5-integrin uptake (Gioelli et al., 2018). Interestingly, multiple reports suggest that semaphorin3 family proteins, including SEMA3A signaling, reduces Akt activity (Eickholt et al., 2002; Manns et al., 2012; Castro-Rivera et al., 2008; Chadborn et al., 2006). Moreover, overexpression of dominant-negative phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) C124S reduced SEMA3A-induced growth cone collapse (Chadborn et al., 2006), while in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells SEMA3B signaling was blocked by high Akt activity (Castro-Rivera et al., 2008). Finally, NRP1 cytoplasmic tail was suggested to complex and activate PTEN upon semaphorin ligand binding (Delgoffe et al., 2013). Together, these data suggest that SEMA3A signaling reduces Akt activity and, conversely, that high Akt activity can antagonize SEMA3A induced cell collapse.\n\nToconfirmtheeffectofSEMA3AonAktactivity,wetreatedRPE wt cells with SEMA3A for 1 h and found a reduction in Ser473 phosphorylation (Figures 7A, 7B, and S7A). SEMA3A-induced cell collapse was inhibited in cells with clathrin heavy-chain knockdown, confirming that the process was CME dependent (Figure S7B). Next, we set out to test the hypothesis that SH3BP4 was required for SEMA3A signaling. Serum-starved human RPE cells and HMEC1 cells were sensitive to SEMA3Ainduced contraction, while in SH3BP4 KO cells, cell contraction was reduced (Figures 7C, 7D, and S7C). In RPE cells, SH3BP4GFP wt and S246A rescued SEMA3A signaling, while dCME did not, suggesting that SH3BP4 was involved in a CME-dependent way (Figure 7D). RPE cells lacking NRP1 or GIPC1 were resistant to SEMA3A signaling (Figures S7D and S7E). Together, this suggested that GIPC1 and SH3BP4 were involved in SEMA3A signaling in a CME-dependent way. When serum-starved RPE cells expressing wild-type SH3BP4-GFP were observed by TIRF microscopy during SEMA3A signaling (Figure 7E), cells contracted over the 60 min of treatment (Figures 7F and 7G), preferentially from the cell edge that exhibited the highest SH3BP4-GFP localization (Figures S7F-S7N). In response to SEMA3A signaling, SH3BP4-GFP intensities at tdTomato-Clca labeled CCPs increased compared with untreated cells, indicating enhanced recruitment of SH3BP4-GFP (Figure 7H). SH3BP4-GFP dCME was not recruited to CCPs by SEMA3A (Figure S7O). The SEMA3A-induced accumulation of SH3BP4-GFP to CCPs was also absent in NRP1 and GIPC1 KO cells (Figures S7P and S7Q). When constitutively active Akt (Akt-ca) was overexpressed, RPEcellsbecameresistantto SEMA3A-inducedcontraction(Figures 7I and S5T) and Akt-ca blocked SH3BP4-GFP accumulation at CCPs (Figure 7J). Finally, SEMA3A enhanced NRP1 uptake but not total a 5-integrin uptake, in line with previous reports suggesting that SEMA3Aenhancestheuptakeofactive a 5-integrin (Gioelli et al., 2018) (Figures 7K and S7R). RPE cells lacking ARHGEF12 or MYO6,twoGIPC1bindingpartners(FigureS4A;TableS5),hadno effect on SH3BP4 mediated endocytosis of NRP1 or total a 5-integrinsandremainedSEMA3Asensitive,indicatingthatthesefactors were not relevant for SH3BP4-mediated endocytosis or signaling (Figures S7S-S7Z). Together, these data suggest that SEMA3A signaling depends on SH3BP4-mediated endocytosis. Moreover, SEMA3A promotes SH3BP4 recruitment to CCPs to enhance endocytosis and cell contraction, and this process is blocked by high Akt activity."

            "subtitle": "## Semaphorin-3a signaling in lung cancer cells depends on active SH3BP4",
            "content": "During tumorigenesis and metastasis, cancer cells adapt to ever-changing microenvironments. At various stages during the transformation, cancer cells experience chemo-attractive and chemorepellent signals from the surrounding tissues (Capparuccia and Tamagnone, 2009). To persist, the development of resistance mechanisms toward repellent signals is advantageous. In human lung cancer, the 3p21 locus is frequently deleted (Sekido et al., 1996; Senchenko et al., 2004) and the semaphorin-3 family gene SEMA3B was identified as a tumor suppressor in this region (Tomizawa et al., 2001; Castro-Rivera et al., 2004; Ji et al., 2005; Kuroki et al., 2003). In NSCLC cell lines, SEMA3B suppressed Akt activity, whereas cells with high Akt activity were resistant to semaphorin signaling (Castro-Rivera et al., 2008). We hypothesized that SH3BP4 could play a role in this balance of SEMA3A signaling. To study the role of the SH3BP4 endocytic mechanism in SEMA3A signaling\n\nin NSCLCs (Figure S8A), we screened a series of NSCLC cell lines for protein expression, Akt activity, and SEMA3A sensitivity (Figures 8A-8C and S8B). As expected, cell lines with low PTEN expression showed increased Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 (pS473) and high pS473, in turn, correlated with resistance to\n\nSEMA3A induced cell contraction (Figure 8C). One such cell line was H157 that was confirmed to express a homozygous PTEN G251C missense mutant (Osoegawa et al., 2017) (Figures S8C and S8D) reported to lack phosphatase activity (Han et al., 2000). In H157, expression of GFP-PTEN wt restored sensitivity\n\nto SEMA3A (Figures 8D and S8E). When SH3BP4-GFP wt and S246A were expressed in H157 the mutant protein was efficiently targeted to CCPs as observed for RPE and endothelial cells (Figures 8E, 8F, S8F and S8G). To address how the reduction of Akt activity would affect SH3BP4-GFP recruitment to CCPs, SNAP-PTEN wt was overexpressed in H157 lowering Akt pS473 levels (Figure S8H). When analyzed by TIRF microscopy, SH3BP4-GFP accumulation at CCPs was elevated in the presence of exogenous PTEN expression (Figures 8G and S8I). This was consistent with the idea that reduced Akt activity would lead to increased SH3BP4 accumulation at CCPs. Finally, to address whether active non-phosphorylatable SH3BP4 S246A could restore SEMA3A sensitivity in H157, we generated SH3BP4 KO cells and reconstituted the cells with SH3BP4-GFP (Figure S8J). When the cells were challenged with SEMA3A for 1 h, the S246A mutant cells contracted (Figure 8H). Together, these data confirm the critical role of SH3BP4 in SEMA3A signaling und supports a model where high Akt activity leads to SEMA3A resistance by phosphorylating SH3BP4 at S246. These results suggest that in cancer cells with low PTEN and high Akt activities, SH3BP4 is inactivated and cells become resistant to semaphorin signaling because of impaired SH3BP4-mediated endocytosis."
