How those E3s discriminate bona fide substrates from other proteins with terminal degron-like sequences remains unclear. Here, we report that human KLHDC2, a CRL2 substrate receptor targeting C-terminal Gly-Gly degrons, is regulated through interconversion between two assemblies. In the self-inactivated homotetramer, KLHDC2's C-terminal Gly-Ser motif mimics a degron and engages the substrate-binding domain of another protomer. True substrates capture the monomeric CRL2 KLHDC2 , driving E3 activation by neddylation and subsequent substrate ubiquitylation. Non-substrates such as NEDD8 bind KLHDC2 with high affinity, but its slow on rate prevents productive association with CRL2 KLHDC2 . Without substrate, neddylated CRL2 KLHDC2 assemblies are deactivated via distinct mechanisms: the monomer by deneddylation and the tetramer by auto-ubiquitylation. Thus, substrate specificity is amplified by KLHDC2 self-assembly acting like a molecular timer, where only bona fide substrates may bind before E3 ligase inactivation.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nThe ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a major pathway regulating eukaryotic protein levels. Selectivity for UPS protein substrates is largely governed by E3 ligases, which modify proteins with ubiquitin (UB) to target them for degradation. 1 Given the importance of the UPS in regulating protein turnover, a major question is how E3 ligases selectively target bona fide substrates while sparing other proteins. 2\n\nE3 ligases possess unique protein interaction domains that recruit substrates by recognizing a molecular motif termed a 'degron. 3 ' Many E3 ligases maintain proteostasis in quality control pathways, and such E3s typically detect degrons within native sequences aberrantly exposed upon errors in protein synthesis, folding, or complex assembly. 4-9 Other E3 ligases function in regulatory cascades, selectively binding degrons modified post-translationally by phosphorylation or prolyl hydroxylation. 10\n\nYet, another theme in the field of E3 specificity is the recognition of degrons at protein termini. 11-13 The first degrons identified-more than 30 years ago-are hydrophobic or basic amino acids at protein N termini. 14 Such sequences bind distinct domains within a family ''N-degron'' E3 ligases, as well as bacterial Clp-family proteases. 15-17 Recently, several other E3 ligase substrate-binding domains (SBDs) were shown to recognize degrons at either N or C termini. Some of these terminal degrons were identified serendipitously, 18-20 whereas others were identified by global protein stability (GPS) technology, a highthroughput method for profiling UPS substrates. 21-23\n\nHowisspecificity for terminal degrons established by E3s? For some, regulation is achieved through the controlled formation of terminal degrons, such as proteolytic cleavage yielding fragments with C- and/or N-degrons, or by enzymatic addition or modification of amino acids at protein termini. 11,24 Alternatively, E3 ligases can be regulated by the metabolically controlled incorporation of SBDs into multiprotein complexes. 25-28\n\nNonetheless, for many E3 ligases recognizing terminal degrons, the question remains as to how true substrates are distinguished from those naturally bearing degron-like amino acidsequences. 17,29-35 In this regard, a particularly vexing terminal degron E3 ligase is CRL2 KLHDC2 , a member of the CRL2 family of\n\nmultiprotein cullin-RING ligases (CRLs). 21,22,29 Prior GPS screens and crystal structures revealed the Gly-Gly C terminus as the primary feature of CRL2 KLHDC2 substrate degrons. 21,22,29,36,37 Identification of CRL2 KLHDC2 substrates by GPS profiling revealed roles in selenoprotein quality control and signal-induced regulation by targeting the deubiquitylating enzyme USP1 during DNA repair. 18,21,22,29,37,38 Because KLHDC2's SBD binds peptide-like sequences with a C-terminal Gly-Gly sequence, it remains perplexing how CRL2 KLHDC2 avoids targeting UB and Ub-like proteins (UBLs) that contain flexible C termini terminating with Gly-Gly. Crystal structures of the KLHDC2 SBD in complex with C-terminal degron peptides revealed an extensive constellation of KHLDC2 basic and aromatic residues anchoring the substrates C-terminal diGly motif. 29 KHLDC2'spropensity to tolerate diverse sequences upstream of the diGly motif is explained by interactions with only backbonecarbonyls of three of four upstream residues of the substrate. Although structural studies raised the possibility that a UBL protein might bind the KLHDC2SBD,prior GPS studiessuggested that GFP-UB had the negligible ability to trigger its KLHDC2dependent degradation. 22,37\n\nHere, by investigating how CRL2 KLHDC2 excludes the UBL NEDD8 as a substrate, we report biochemical, structural, and cell biological studies that collectively reveal a unique substrate mimicry mediating self-assembly of KHLDC2-EloBC as a specificity amplification mechanism that restricts ubiquitylation to bona fide substrates.\n",

            "content": "We confirmed how KLHDC2 binds C-degrons by determining the crystal structure of its SBD in complex with a peptide derived from EPHB2 (Figure 1A, Table 1). KLHDC2 sidechains cradle the substrate C-terminal Gly-Gly residues, making limited contact with the sidechains of preceding residues (Figure 1A). Thus, consistent with prior structures, we observed an apparent lack of sequence requirements for residues preceding the diGly motif. 29\n\nTo determine if KLHDC2 binds to ubiquitin (UB) or the UB-like protein NEDD8, we developed a competitive binding assay. Briefly, time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) occurs upon binding of a fluorescently labeled substrate peptide from Ric8B to the SBD of KLHDC2-proteins are assayed for binding to KLHDC2 based on their inhibition of the TR-FRET signal. The titration of two CRL2 KLHDC2 substrates (SELK or USP1) resulted in the loss of the TR-FRET signal\n\n(Figure 1B). Consistent with prior studies, UB was not an effective competitor, 22,37 but unexpectedly, NEDD8 inhibited the KLHDC2-Ric8B interaction. A NEDD8 mutant whose C-terminal Gly residue was mutated to Asp could not compete (Figure 1B), consistent with the essential nature of the diGly motif in binding to KLHDC2.\n\nTo determine whether NEDD8 can serve as a CRL2 KLHDC2 substrate, we assayed ubiquitylation employing a ''pulse-chase'' format that detects neddylated CRL2 KLHDC2 -dependent transfer (CRL2-family members are activated by post-translational modification with the UBL NEDD8 through a process called neddylation) of labeled UB (*UB) from UBE2R2. In the absence of substrate, KLHDC2 is rapidly ubiquitylated. However, instead of auto-ubiquitylation of KLHDC2, neddylated CRL2 KLHDC2 preferentially promotes *UB ligation to SELK or USP1 when present in the reaction mixtures (Figures 1C and 1D). Surprisingly, despite the ability of free NEDD8 to bind KLHDC2's SBD, little *UB transfer to NEDD8 was observed. Instead, KLHDC2 was still auto-ubiquitylated to the extent observed in assays lacking substrate (Figure 1C). The results suggest that (1) complex formation with KLHDC2's SBD is necessary but not sufficient for substrate ubiquitylation, (2) the CRL2 KLHDC2 complex has the means to distinguish between SBD protein interactors and bona fide substrates, and (3) the latter protect KLHDC2 from autoubiquitylation."

            "content": "To gain insights into how the KLHDC2-EloBC substrate receptor complex is regulated, we determined its crystal structure at 2.6 A \u02da resolution (Table 1). Unexpectedly, the SBD of each KLHDC2 protomer was occupied by the C terminus from the adjacent KLHDC2 in the crystal. The C-terminal Ser, penultimate Gly, and preceding 4 residues superimpose with true substrate degrons bound to KLHDC2's isolated SBD (Figures 2A, S1A, and S1B). 29 To rule out the possibility that the interaction was artifactually imposed by crystal packing, the observed binding mode was confirmed with another crystal structure of the isolated SBD bound to a peptide corresponding to the KLHDC2 C terminus (Figure 2B, Table 1).\n\nMeasuring affinities of interactions between the KLHDC2 SBD and peptides by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) showed that the wild-type (WT) KLHDC2-derived peptide bound to the KLHDC2 SBD with a KD of 1.4 m M (Figure 2C). This is only 3-5fold lower affinity than KD values for peptides from physiological substrates, USP1's N-terminal UBL domain ( KD of 0.26 uM) or GFP-RIC8B ( KD of 0.46 uM, Figure S1C). Interestingly, a single amino acid replacement of the KLHDC2 C-terminal Ser with Gly increased the affinity by more than three orders of magnitude, owing to a much slower off rate (Figure 2C). As predicted from the structure, mutation of the Gly-Ser motif to Lys-Lys completely abolished binding (Figure 2C). Thus, the KLHDC2 C\n\nterminus mimics a degron, but with a sequence motif of intermediate affinity."

            "subtitle": "## KLHDC2-EloBC forms a substrate mimic-induced tetramer",
            "content": "The ability of the KLHDC2 degron mimicking C terminus (hereafter referred to as C-degron-mimic) to engage another molecule of KHLDC2's SBD suggested that such interactions could avidly stabilize the self-assembly of the substrate receptor complex. To test for oligomerization in solution, we employed size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multi-angle light scattering. The data revealed an estimated mass of 280.8 kDa for the complex, which matches the calculated mass of a tetrameric KLHDC2EloBC complex (282.1kDa, Figure 3A, hereafter we refer to\n\n''tetramer'' as four KLHDC2-EloBC complexes in a singular assembly, and ''monomer'' as one KLHDC2-EloBC complex). Performing sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (SV-AUC) at various concentrations revealed a dilution-dependent decrease in tetramer population concomitant with increasing levels of monomer (Figure 3B). The data yielded an estimated KD value for tetramer dissociation of /C24 150 pM. Thus, the KLHDC2-EloBC substrate receptor complex forms an exceptionally stable tetrameric assembly.\n\nThe KLHDC2-EloBC X-ray structure revealed the molecular mechanism of tetramer formation: the asymmetric unit contained two KLHDC2-EloBC complexes that together with two flanking complexes in the crystallographic lattice formed a tetramer (Figures 2A, S1A, and S1B). We term the non-equivalent\n\nKLHDC2-EloBC complexes as protomers A or B and symmetryrelated protomers A' and B 0 (Figure 2A). Each protomer is connected to two others by interactions between SBDs and KLHDC2 C-degron-mimics. For instance, the C-degron-mimic of protomer A occupies the SBD of protomer B, and the SBD from A is occupied by the C-degron-mimic of protomer B 0 . As such, the tetrameric arrangement is closed since all SBDs are engaged (Figure 2A).\n\nAlthough each copy of the KLHDC2 SBD and the BC-boxEloBC complex superimposed with the prior structures of these domains (Figures S1D and S1E), 29,39 the helices emanating from the BC-box and preceding the C-degron mimic approach protomersAandB(orA 0 and B 0 ) from different orientations (Figure 3C). The distinct trajectories depend on inter-protomer interactions that establish the specific closed tetrameric arrangement (Figure 3D). The 6 C-terminal residues of KLHDC2 A are guided into the substrate-binding pocket of KLHDC2 B by two unique sets of interactions. First, the backside of the BC-box helix of KLHDC2 A, opposite the face bound to EloBC, interacts with the b -propeller SBD from KLHDC2 B (Figure 3E, left panel). Also, the CUL2-box from subunit A forms an a -helical structure that is buttressed on both sides by KLHDC2 B (Figure 3E, left panel). Second, the b -propellers from protomers B and A 0 are arranged in a head-to-tail fashion that creates an extensive interaction surface between solvent-exposed residues from Kelch-repeat 5 (KR5) and KR6 from protomer B, with those from KR1 and KR2 from protomer A 0 (Figure 3E, right panel). As a result, instead of extensive interactions with a nearby protomer, the backside of the BC-box of KLHDC2 B interacts with the extreme C-terminal sequence of its own CUL2-box, thereby stabilizing its C-degron-mimic proximal to the substrate-binding pocket of KLHDC2 A 0 (Figures 3C and 3E, right panel). The KLHDC2 B-A' subunit interaction is further stabilized by loop elements from KLHDC2 A' interacting with elements from the BC-box and EloC from protomer B (Figure 3E, right panel).\n\nWithin the interactions described above, two tetramerization elements (TEs) define the specific geometry. The formation of the closed tetramer would prevent the assembly of filament structures by unchecked head-to-tail binding between KLHDC2 SBDs and C-degronmimics(FigureS2A).Thetetramericstructuresuggested that a loop within KLHDC2 KR4 serves as one TE (TE1), displaying several residues including Phe177, Phe182, and Trp183 that collectively interact with TE2 (Ile373 and the backside of the BC-box) of an adjacent KHLDC2 subunit (Figure 3E, left panel).\n\nThe roles of KLHDC2 sequences predicted to stabilize the tetramer were characterized through mutagenesis and monitoring the migration pattern of these mutants by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. Deleting KLHDC2's C-terminal 6 residues\n\n(C D 6 mutant, Figure 3E), either alone or together with the CUL2-binding 'CUL2-box' ( D C2B), converted KLHDC2-EloBC to a monomeric species (Figure 3F). Notably, the C D 6 mutant also terminates with Gly-Ser, suggesting the length of the KLHDC2 C terminus has evolved to engage the adjacent subunit (Figure 3E). A mutant with the KLHDC2 C-terminal Gly-Ser dipeptide replaced with Lys-Lys (-KK) also migrated as a monomer (Figure 3F, confirmed by AUC, Figure S2B), as does a mutant in the SBD (S269E) previously demonstrated to disrupt C-degron binding (Figure 3F). 29\n\nMutation of the C-degron mimics to the optimal degron sequence Gly-Gly (-GG) resulted in multiple species whose gel migrations were indicative of a range of oligomers from dimers to assemblies larger than tetramers (Figure 3F). Importantly, the mutation of TE1 or TE2 was destabilizing leading to the appearance of trimeric and dimeric species (Figure 3F). These results demonstrate that KLHDC2's C-terminal degron mimic is indispensable for oligomerization, but additional elements constrain the assembly to the closed tetramer thwarting the formation of varying oligomeric species.\n\nThe tetrameric KLHDC2-EloBC assembly is shared with at least one closely related CRL2-based C-degron substrate receptor, KLHDC3 (Figure S3). As predicted from its C-terminal -His-Gly sequence, purified KLHDC3-EloBC migrated with a mass consistent with a tetrameric assembly (Figures S3B and S3C). On the other hand, KLHDC10-EloBC was monomeric, consistent with the divergence of its C-terminal sequence from its cognate degron (Figures S3B, S3I, and S3J)."

            "subtitle": "## The KLHDC2-EloBC tetramer is autoinhibited for substrate binding",
            "content": "Several experiments indicated that the KLHDC2-EloBC self-assembly is autoinhibited for substrate binding. First, the potential for KLHDC2-EloBC to interact with a fluorescein-labeled fragment fromthesubstrateSELK(FAM-SELK)wasexaminedbynon-denaturing gel electrophoresis. FAM-SELK alone was not observed in the gel, presumably due to its small size ( /C24 5,700Da) and high chargedensity (pI = 11.5). Upon mixing with KLHDC2-EloBC a single band appeared (Figures 4A and S2C). A substantially greater signal was observed with monomeric -KK mutant. Similar migration in the gel raised the possibility that the WT KLHDC2-EloBC complex was also monomeric when bound to FAM-SELK (Figures 4A and S2C). Interestingly, a FAM-SELK band was not observed with the stabilized -GG mutant or with the negative control degron-binding-deficient S269E mutant (Figures 4A and S2C-S2E).\n\nThe data raised the possibility that FAM-SELK could capture monomericKLHDC2-EloBCpresentfromslowtetramer/monomer\n\ninterconversion at equilibrium. This model predicts that the KLHDC2-SELKinteractionshouldincreasewithbothgreater incubation time and increasing substrate concentration, which were both confirmed in experiments with WT KLHDC2-EloBC (Figures 4A, 4B, and S2F). However, neither an 18-h pre-incubation nor a 4-molar excess of FAM-SELK was sufficient to achieve the level of interaction observed with KLHDC2-EloBC -KK. The identity of the substrate and its affinity for isolated KLHDC2 SBD also appeared to be important (Figures 1B and S1C). Compared with FAM-SELK, for which a 4-fold molar excess allowed substantial complex formation with KLHDC2-EloBC, a 20-fold molar excess of FAM-USP1 was required for only minimal interaction (Figures 4B and S2F).\n\nTo further explore the parameters of conversion from tetrameric KLHDC2-EloBC to substrate-bound monomer, we performed analytical size-exclusion chromatography after various incubation periods for KLHDC2-EloBC and substrate. Without incubation, the tetrameric form of KLHDC2-EloBC and MBPfused SELK fragments migrate in discrete fractions across an SD200 column. Mixing the two for extended time periods led to the migration of a stoichiometric MBP-SELK:KLHDC2EloBC complex (Figure S2G). Modeling the distribution of tetramer and MBP-SELK-KLHDC2-EloBC species under various incubation times enabled the computational estimation of the rates of tetramer dissociation and association (Figures S2G and S2H). Interestingly, the estimated KD (180-260 pM) agrees with the experimentally derived value from SV-AUC experiments performed in the absence of substrate ( KD = 158 pM, Figure 3B), suggesting that substrate does not directly stimulate tetramer dissociation. Furthermore, the range of estimated kinetic rates for tetramer dissociation (2-2.5 3 10 5 s -1 ) suggests KLHDC2EloBC tetramers dissociate with a half-life of &gt;12 h, consistent with the time course of substrate binding observed in non-denaturing gel electrophoresis (Figures 4A and S2C).\n\nThe prolonged incubation times required for substrate binding to KLHDC2-EloBC seemed to exceed a biologically relevant time scale. Thus, we considered if substrate binding may synergize with other facets of an active CRL2 KHLDC2 E3 ligase. Indeed, in the non-denaturing gel mobility shift assay, adding CUL2-RBX1 reduced the required pre-incubation time for KLHDC2-FAMSELK complex formation to &lt;3 h (Figure 4C, left panel), whereas a monomeric neddylated CRL-KLHDC2-EloBC-substrate complex required no pre-incubation (Figure 4C, right panel). In summary, although KLHDC2-EloBC on its own slowly dissociates into a monomer capable of binding to substrates, dissociation was greatly accelerated in the neddylated CRL KLHDC2 complex that is activated for ubiquitylation.\n\nStructural modeling provided a rationale for the accelerated dissociation. First, we superimposed EloBC-CUL2-RBX1 from the prior structure of CRL2 VHL onto the corresponding region of the KLHDC2-EloBC tetramer, which showed the CUL2 binding sites are only accessible in the B and B' protomers (Figures S4A and S4B). 40,41 Second, we confirmed this arrangement by SEC-MALS (multi-angle light-scattering) (Figures S4C and S4D). For the KLHDC2 -KK monomer bound to either CUL2-RBX1 or NEDD8 /C24 CUL2-RBX1, the observed masses of 170.3 and 182.7 kDa agrees with the calculated mass of a 1:1 complex (Figures S4C and S4D). For WT KLHDC2-EloBC-CUL2-RBX1, the peak was broad and deconvoluted into at least two distinct complexes. The leading edge of the peak with an estimated mass of 456.7 kDa is within experimental error of the calculated molecular mass for a KLHDC2-EloBC tetramer bound to two copies of CUL2-RBX1 ( /C24 480 kDa). The lagging edge of the peak corresponded to an estimated mass of 427.5 kDa. Although we cannotunequivocallydefinethiscomplexassembly,theestimated mass is consistent with a trimeric KLHDC2-EloBC ( /C24 210 kDa) bound to two CUL2-RBX1 subcomplexes ( /C24 200 kDa). For WT KLHDC2-EloBC-NEDD8 /C24 CUL2-RBX1, the estimated mass was388kDa,consistentwithatetramericKLHDC2-EloBCassembly ( /C24 280 kDa) bound to one NEDD8 /C24 CUL2-RBX1 moiety ( /C24 110 kDa). In summary, the data are consistent with dynamic assembly between KLHDC2-EloBC and CUL2-RBX1, resulting in a sample that contained both two CUL2-RBX1 bound to a KLHDC2-EloBC tetrameric assembly and another sub-complex, seemingly of this where one KLHDC2-EloBC entity has dissociated. These results are consistent with accelerated dissociation of the KLHDC2-EloBC tetramer in the presence of CUL2-RBX1. In addition, the predominant complex of KLHDC2-EloBC tetramer with one NEDD8 /C24 CUL2-RBX1 is consistent with the notion that clashing between the tetrameric assembly and both NEDD8 and the CUL2 and RBX1 domains (that become mobilized by neddylation) reduces the overall stability relative to the 4:2 KLHDC2EloBC:CUL2-RBX1 assembly. Indeed, analytical sizing runs of WT KLHDC2-EloBC NEDD8 /C24 CUL2-RBX1 with or without the SELK fragment confirm that NEDD8 /C24 CUL2-RBX1 accelerates KLHDC2-EloBC tetrameric disassembly (Figures S4E and S4F), although peak overlap between oligomeric KLHDC2EloBC-NEDD8 /C24 CUL2-RBX1 and substrate-bound monomeric KLHDC2-EloBC-NEDD8 /C24 CUL2-RBX1 prevented accurate quantification of these species precluding kinetic modeling as in Figures S2G and S2H.\n\nTo further corroborate these ideas, we obtained an 8.2 A \u02da resolution cryo electron microscopy (EM) map of CRL2 KLHDC2 (Figures 4D and S5A). The EM density was readily fit with the\n\ncrystallographically determined KLHDC2-EloBC tetramer, and CUL2 bound to protomers B and B 0 . As is typical for CRL structures, density for the catalytic regions-CUL2's C-terminal ''WHB'' domain and RBX1's RING domain-was visible only at low contour and resolution, precluding the unambiguous orientation of these domains. Nonetheless, they are adjacent to EloBC and KLHDC2, respectively, from protomer A or A 0 (Figure 4D). By analogy to other CRLs in which the cullin WHB and RBX1RINGdomainsareflexibly tethered, it seems likely that positions accessible to these domains would sterically clash with the tetramer. 42-44 This would be further exacerbated for the neddylated complex in which NEDD8, the CUL2 WHB domain to which it is linked, and RBX1's RING domain would all be expected to sample multiple conformations. 42-46\n\nTo gain insights into potential catalytic functions of tetramerization, we superimposed a prior structure of a CRL2 substrate receptor bound to a protein substrate (a PROTAC-mediated complex between VHL-EloBC and second bromodomain from BRD4) onto protomer B, which can bind CUL2. 47 This comparison revealed that KLHDC2 A' recruited to KLHDC2 B is similarly positioned as a substrate (Figure 4E), suggesting that KLHDC2 tetramerization could promote its auto-ubiquitylation. Indeed, ubiquitylation assays showed that only versions of KLHDC2 that oligomerize (WT without substrate and -GG with or without substrate) are subject to auto-ubiquitylation (Figure 4F), whereas the obligate monomer KLHDC2 -KK is only marginally auto-ubiquitylated even in the absence of substrate."

            "content": "The structural and biochemical results hint at the intricate interplay between the degron-mimic-mediated KLHDC2 tetramer and monomer capture by the substrate. To further explore why NEDD8 was a relatively poor ubiquitylation substrate in pulsechase assays despite its comparable affinity with USP1 for the KLHDC2 SBD, rapid quench flow was employed to quantify pre-steady-state kinetic parameters. In reactions with KLHDC2 -KK and following a 1-h equilibration of the substrate with E3, the rate of NEDD8 modification was surprisingly faster than for the bona fide substrates USP1 and SELK (Figures S6A-S6D, kobs 0.30s-1 NEDD8, 0.21s-1 USP1, and 0.10s-1 SELK). Thus, NEDD8 has the potential to serve as a substrate if sufficient time is provided for the formation of a KLHDC2-substrate complex (Figures S6A-S6D).\n\nNext, qualitative ubiquitylation reactions were performed comparing *UB transfer to USP1 or NEDD8 after varying pre-incubation periods between substrate and NEDD8 /C24 CRL2 KLHDC2 . Maximal ubiquitylation of USP1 was achieved after a 5-min preincubation, whereas under identical conditions with NEDD8, the majority of *UB partitioned to KLHDC2 (Figures 5A and 5B). Even a 30-min pre-incubation with NEDD8 was not sufficient to fully direct *UB conjugation to NEDD8 (Figure S6E). With KLHDC2-KK,maximalubiquitylation of UPS1 required no pre-incubation, whereasthepre-incubationrequiredforNEDD8ubiquitylation was reduced to &lt;5 min (Figures 5A and 5B).\n\nThe extended pre-incubation requirement suggested that NEDD8 associates with KLHDC2 relatively slowly. Indeed, the association rate of NEDD8, as measured by SPR, was an order-of-magnitude slower (Figure 5C, 5.5 3 10 3 M /C0 1 s /C0 1 ) than that of USP1 or SELK (4.9 3 10 4 and 3 3 10 4 , respectively). Despite NEDD8's slow rate of association, its equilibrium binding affinity is comparable with USP1 (211 versus 264 nM), due to an order-of-magnitude slower rate of dissociation (Figure 5C).\n\nStructural analysis suggested that NEDD8's C-terminal tail might be too short to enable a rapid association with KLHDC2. 22,37 This was tested for with a panel of NEDD8 variants extending the C-terminal tail by inserting 2, 4, or 6 residues (1, 2, or 3 GlySer repeats, respectively) upstream of the -GG. SPR measurements confirmed that the NEDD8 mutants rescued the rate of association with KLHDC2 (Figure 5D). Consistent with this, the insertion variantswerereadilyubiquitylatedwithoutpre-incubation (Figures 5E and 5F). Taken together, the data indicate that C-degron mimicry-induced KLHDC2 tetramerization excludes NEDD8 as a substrate due to its slow on rate, whereas bona fide substrates possess on rates that are sufficient to capture the monomeric form of neddylated CRL2 KLHDC2 within the monomer-tetramer equilibrium."

            "content": "Given the importance of neddylation in activating CRL-dependent ubiquitylation, we tested the effects of mutations impacting the C-degron mimic-mediated tetramerization on NEDD8 transfer to CRL2 KLHDC2 , the inhibition of this reaction by CAND1, and deneddylation mediated by the COP9 signalosome (CSN). Assays were performed with or without a C-degron peptide or a bona fide C-degron protein substrate, which both shift the tetramer-to-monomer equilibrium for WT CRL2 KLHDC2 , while also having complementary structural properties of being small (peptide) or large (protein).\n\nThe results showed a striking trend: monomeric versions of KLHDC2-EloBC, in some cases bound to a substrate protein, were preferentially neddylated. For example, the rate of CUL2RBX1 neddylation was greatest with the -KK monomeric mutant of KLHDC2-EloBC, with or without a bound substrate, and for the tetramer supplied with a substrate that captures the monomer (Figures 6A, left panel, and S7A). The same trend was also observed in the presence of CAND1, whose inhibition of neddylation of other CRLs has been shown to be overcome by their binding to substrate receptors (Figures 6A, right panel, and S7B).\n\nThe effects of tetramerization and substrate binding on deneddylation of NEDD8 /C24 CRL2 KLHDC2 were more intricate but agreed with structural modeling. Briefly, superimposing the EloBC-CUL2 portion of the complex on a prior cryo-EM map of CSN-bound to neddylated CRL2 VHL showed substantial clashing between CSN with the tetramer, explaining its inhibition of deneddylation (Figures 6B and S7C). 45 By contrast, less clashing is observed with a monomeric NEDD8 /C24 CRL2 KLHDC2 , explaining increased deneddylation rates of the monomeric -KK mutant, and of this mutant and WT NEDD8 /C24 CRL2 KLHDC2 in the presence of a small C-degron peptide (Figures 6B and S7C). As with other CRLs, the binding of a larger protein substrate would substantially obstruct CSN, thus explaining why a substrate protein (MBP-SELK) maintains NEDD8 on monomeric versions of CRL2 KLHDC2 (Figures 6B and S7C). 48,49\n\nThe increased rate of CUL2 neddylation in the presence of monomeric versions of KLHDC2-EloBC was unexpected as cullin neddylation is not typically influenced in vitro by substrate receptors. However, modeling a CRL2 KLHDC2 neddylation complex by superimposing the prior structure of the NEDD8 ligation machinery onto monomeric KLHDC2-EloBC showed that residues corresponding to KLHDC2 TE1, which are buried in the tetramer but exposed in the monomer, are proximal to UBE2M\n\n(which catalyzes NEDD8 transfer to cullin, Figure 6C). 50 Michaelis-Menten kinetics on the neddylation reaction revealed that, in comparison to the values for CUL2-RBX1 alone, adding monomeric KLHDC2-EloBC -KK resulted in a /C24 17-fold increase in the maximal rate of neddylation (Vmax.) with little impact on the Michaelis constant (Km) (Figure 6D). Furthermore, although similar rates of neddylation were achieved by adding substrate to WT CRL2 KLHDC2 (Figure 6A, left panel), this was largely\n\n(A) Normalized rates of CUL2 Neddylation by NEDD8 /C24 UBE2M in the absence (left panel) or presence (right panel) of CAND1 and with WT or the indicated KLHDC2-EloBC C-degron mutants and with or without SELK peptide.\n\n(D) Velocity of CUL2 Neddylation versus NEDD8 /C24 UBE2M concentration.

Importantly, the activation of neddylation by monomeric KLHDC2-EloBC required binding to CUL2, as a truncated version of CUL2-RBX1 that is competent for neddylation but cannot bind substrate receptors did not show KLHDC2-dependent stimulation of CUL2 neddylation (Figure S7E). Thus, the monomeric CRL2 KLHDC2 complex seems specifically arranged in a manner to promote the formation of the catalytically competent conformation of neddylation enzymes, although future studies will be required to determine the precise structural mechanism."

            "content": "We sought to gain insights into the potential roles of KLHDC2's C-degron mimic mediating self-assembly in cells. Analysis of whole-cell lysates from transiently transfected 293T cells by gel filtration chromatography showed KLHDC2 migrating across numerous fractions (from &lt;660,000 to 75,000 Da, Figure S8A), presumably due to its bewildering number of interacting partners. We thus tested whether mutations affecting tetramer formation in vitro resulted in similar outcomes in cells.\n\nWe first examined the impact on CUL2 deneddylation. After confirming that CSN activity is maintained in lysis buffer conditions (Figure S8B), we performed transient transfections of 293T cells with FLAG-tagged WT or mutant KLHDC2, lysates were prepared in either the absence or presence of excess of SELK peptide, and with or without pharmacological inhibitors of neddylation (MLN4924) or deneddylation (CSN5i). Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitants were analyzed by immunoblotting for associated proteins. In the absence of any treatment, WT KLHDC2 co-precipitated a mixture of unmodified and neddylated CUL2. However, the monomeric -KK KLHDC2 mutant co-immunoprecipitated unneddylated CUL2, whereas the stabilized -GG KLHDC2 mutant preferentially associated with fully neddylated CUL2 (Figure 7A). Notably, as with experiments performed in vitro with purified components (Figure 6B), the addition of SELK peptide-stimulated CUL2 deneddylation in complexes with WT KLHDC2 and the inclusion of CSNi5 confirmed CSN as responsible for CUL2 deneddylation (Figure 7A).\n\nWe also examined the effects of tetramerization mutants on KLHDC2 protein levels in U2OS cells. After the CRISPR-mediated knockout of endogenous KLHDC2, stable cell lines were generated via lentiviral transduction of FLAG-tagged WT or mutant KLHDC2. Although the endogenous expression levels of KLHDC2 in U2OS cells are low, such that the exogenous\n\nFLAG-tagged WT KLHDC2 protein is expressed at roughly 10-fold higher, the amount of FLAG-KLHDC2 matched endogenous levels seen in other cell lines such as PC-3 and HepG2 (Figure S8C). Notably, the normalized protein levels for the KLHDC2 variants differed, where both WT and -GG KLHDC2 protein levels were significantly lower than that of C D 6 and -KK monomers. The D C2B KLHDC2 variant displayed the highest protein levels, presumably due to its failure to interact with CUL2 preventing auto-ubiquitylation. Consistent with this notion, the treatment of the cell lines with MLN4924 stabilized both tetrameric and monomeric KLHDC2 variants to levels comparable with that of D C2B KLHDC2 (Figure 7B). Cell lines containing KLHDC2 variants were also treated with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, followed by FLAG immunoprecipitation and the detection of poly-ubiquitylated KLHDC2 by anti-K48 specific ubiquitin antibodies (Figure S8D). The KLHDC2 tetramer and stabilized -GG mutant was indeed more ubiquitylated than their monomeric counterparts, although surprisingly, D C2B KLHDC2 was also ubiquitylated, presumably in a CUL2-independent manner as MLN4924 treatment fails to stabilize this mutant (Figure 7B). Taken together, the cellular data are consistent with the in vitro biochemical data indicating that the C-degron mimicry-mediated tetramerization of KLHDC2 inhibits CSN-mediated deneddylation of CUL2 and promotes its auto-ubiquitylation.\n\nNext, we tested the mutants for effects on substrate degradation. Steady-state levels of the USP1 N-fragment were marginally but consistently increased in the KLHDC2 knockout cell line, whereas full-length USP1 levels were unchanged (Figures 7C and 7D). The exogenous rescue of WT KLHDC2 resulted in an approximately 4-fold reduction of USP1 N-fragment levels, whereas the levels were unchanged upon the expression of D C2B KLHDC2, which neither tetramerizes nor binds CUL2. Importantly, expressing monomeric C D 6 and -KK versions of KLHDC2 further reduced levels of USP1 N-fragment (Figures 7C and7D).Theseresults are consistent with the tetrameric assembly downregulating CRL2 KLHDC2 activity.\n\nExperiments with mutant cell lines also suggested that the KLHDC2 oligomeric assembly affects NEDD8 levels in cells. Unlike USP1, the deletion of KLHDC2 in U2OS cells had no significant effect on NEDD8 protein levels, suggesting KLHDC2 levels are finely tuned such that NEDD8 is unperturbed by its presence in cells. However, ectopic expression of WT KLHDC2 reduced the levels of unconjugated NEDD8 (Figures 7E and 7F). Expression of monomeric -KK KLHDC2 resulted in the further decrease of NEDD8 protein levels, whereas both -GG\n\nand D C2B KLHDC2 expression restored NEDD8 to levels observed in WT U2OS cells (Figures 7E and 7F). In summary, these results support the notion of a synergistic relationship between the capacity of KLHDC2 to form a C-degron mimicmediated self-restrained tetramer and the absolute levels of both KLHDC2 and NEDD8 in cells."
