Here, we show that the RNA binding protein HTATSF1 controls embryonic stem cell differentiation by regulating multiple aspects of RNA processing during ribosome biogenesis. HTATSF1, in a complex with splicing factor SF3B1, controls intron removal from ribosomal protein transcripts and regulates ribosomal RNA transcription and processing, thereby controlling 60S ribosomal abundance and protein synthesis. HTATSF1-dependent protein synthesis is essential for naive pre-implantation epiblast to transition into post-implantation epiblast, a stage with transiently low protein synthesis, and further differentiation toward neuroectoderm. Together, these results identify coordinated regulation of ribosomal RNA and protein synthesis by HTATSF1 and show that this essential mechanism controls protein synthesis during early mammalian embryogenesis.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nCell-fate transitions are regulated by signaling pathways that integrate extracellular signals with cell-intrinsic transcriptional programs. Cell-essential events like mRNA splicing and protein synthesis, in contrast, have been regarded as housekeeping processes common to all cells without major fate determining roles. More recently, however, unexpected roles for these processes are beginning to emerge. Here, we show that changes in protein synthesis and RNA processing can influence cell fate during early mammalian development.\n\nEarly mammalian development is characterized by a gradual loss of pluripotency. The pre-implantation epiblast produces all\n\nsomatic and germline cells of the embryo and exemplifies a state termed ''naive'' pluripotency reflected by expression of a specific set of transcription factors and a hypomethylated genome (Boroviak et al., 2014; Nichols and Smith, 2012). In vitro , mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) cultured in 2i/LIF most closely resemble the naive pre-implantation epiblast (E4.5 in mouse) (Boroviak et al., 2015). After implantation, the early post-implantation epiblast undergoes major cellular changes entering a phase of ''formative'' pluripotency, probably best reflected in vitro by ''epiblast-like cells'' (EpiLCs) that are transcriptionally similar to the pre-gastrulation E5.5-E6.0 epiblast (Hayashi et al., 2011; Kalkan et al., 2017; Smith, 2017). Subsequently, epiblast cells start to regionally express specification factors and initiate gastrulation. This ''primed'' phase of late pluripotency has been studied using ''epiblast stem cells'' (EpiSCs), a heterogeneous population of cells with transcriptional similarities to the late gastrula-stage epiblast (Kojima et al., 2014).\n\nConventionally derived human ESCs (hESCs) are in a primed pluripotent state in vitro but can be converted to naive pluripotency (Takashima et al., 2014; Weinberger et al., 2016). Both, human and mouse ESCs can be differentiated into the three germ-layers ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm and thus provide an accessible in vitro system to study the major regulatory processes during gastrulation.\n\nSplicing is an mRNA processing event essential for the synthesis of most proteins. Intron retention is a specific form of alternative splicing (Braunschweig et al., 2014). Failure to remove one or more introns within a given transcript can result in mRNA decay and reduced protein production. It is currently estimated that 5%-10% of all mRNAs contain retained introns (Boutz et al., 2015). Intron retention allows the rapid adjustment of transcript and protein levels without the need for transcriptional changes. It is involved in diverse biological functions ranging from granulocyte differentiation to neuronal excitability control (Bell et al., 2010; Braunschweig et al., 2014; Mauger et al., 2016; Wong et al., 2013). The mechanisms that regulate intron retention during cell-fate specification are currently not well understood.\n\nAnother basic cellular process relevant for cell-fate specification is protein synthesis. Tight control of protein translation is imperative for differentiation, proliferation, and growth of diverse types of stem cells in several organisms (Blanco et al., 2016;\n\nSanchez et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2014). In hematopoietic stem cells, for example, both an increase or decrease in protein synthesis impairs proper function (Signer et al., 2014). Further, regulation of protein synthesis and protein homeostasis can orchestrate developmental changes rather than simply responding to them (Noormohammadi et al., 2018).\n\nOur data establish the RNA binding protein HTATSF1 as a regulator of ribosomal protein levels and ribosomal RNA resulting in changes in protein synthesis. HTATSF1 is conserved from yeast to humans and contains two RNA binding RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains and an acidic C terminus. In yeast, the HTATSF1 homolog Cus2 regulates pre-spliceosome assembly (Chathoth et al., 2014). Our data show that HTATSF1 binds to the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex and controls mRNA splicing of ribosomal protein genes. It also influences the production and processing of ribosomal RNA components. This results in changes of levels of the 60S large ribosomal subunit and protein synthesis. HTATSF1 and protein synthesis levels are reduced when ESCs undergo differentiation. Our data reveal a mechanism whereby constitutive, cell-essential processes can cooperate to regulate cell-fate transitions.\n",

            "content": "In Drosophila , HTATSF1/Barricade regulates stem cell lineages (Neum \u20ac uller et al., 2011; Abramczuk et al., 2017). To test whether this role is evolutionarily conserved, we used mouse and hESCs as an in vitro system for self-renewal and differentiation. To assess whether HTATSF1 had a role in maintenance of ESC pluripotency, we asked whether HTATSF1 was expressed in mESCs. ESC cultured under 2i/LIF plus serum conditions expressed high levels of HTATSF1 (Figures 1B, 1I, and S1K). We next asked whether loss of HTATSF1 would interfere with ESC pluripotency. To delete HTATSF1 in ESCs, we generated mice bearing a conditional Htatsf1 loss of function allele by inserting loxP sites flanking Exon3 to Exon6 (Figures S1A and S1B). We derived ESC lines from homozygous mice that carried a heterozygous constitutively expressed CreERT2 insertion ( Htatsf1 fl/fl ;\n\nCreERT2 +/ /C0 ). Upon addition of 4-OH-tamoxifen to ESCs, HTATSF1 was efficiently deleted (Figure S1C). We assessed pluripotency in ESCs by performing immunofluorescence for the pluripotency markers NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2 and testing for colony-reforming efficiency (Figures 1A-1G, S1D, and S1E). While control ESCs expressed high levels of the pluripotency markers NANOG (Figures 1B and 1C), OCT4 (Figures 1D and S1D), and SOX2 (Figures 1E and S1E), these markers were reduced upon loss of HTATSF1, indicating that HTATSF1 is required for pluripotency maintenance. We next assessed colony-reforming efficiency (Figures 1F and 1G). Cells lacking HTATSF1 showed a reduced ability to re-form colonies, an indication that HTATSF1 is required for maintaining pluripotent ESCs. Cells lacking HTATSF1 also accumulated in G2/M phase and after prolonged culture underwent cell death (Figure S1F, data available on request).\n\nTo analyze whether the observed effect on cell cycle was mediated by p53, we stained for p53 in ESCs after 4-OH-tamoxifen treatment. In contrast to control cells, HTATSF1 knockout (KO) cells showed p53 nuclear accumulation, a hallmark of p53 activation (Figure S1G). Thus, p53 signaling could potentially mediate the observed effects upon loss of HTATSF1. p53 has a role in mESC maintenance and differentiation (Lin et al., 2004). To test whether HTATSF1 acts through p53, we generated p53 /C0 / /C0 ESCs ( Htatsf1 fl/fl ; CreERT2 +/ /C0 ; p53 /C0 / /C0 ). Deletion of HTATSF1 in p53-deficient pluripotent ESCs partly rescued the cell-cycle phenotype (Figure S2B). However, levels of NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2 (Figures S2A and S2C-S2H) as well as colony-reforming efficiency (Figures S2I and S2J) were still reduced upon loss of HTATSF1. These results indicate that p53 signaling was not responsible for the loss of pluripotency observed upon HTATSF1 depletion."

            "content": "To understand whether HTATSF1 had a role also in ESC differentiation, we studied HTATSF1 function in embryoid bodies (EBs). EBs were cultured under the defined SFEB (serum-free culture of embryoid-body-like aggregates) conditions, which\n\nallows generation of predominantly neuroectoderm tissue after 5-7 days of culture (Kamiya et al., 2011). During the course of EB differentiation, EBs lose markers of the pluripotent pre-implantation epiblast (Nanog) and start expressing markers of the post-implantation epiblast (Otx2, Oct6, Fgf5) before giving rise to neuroectoderm (N-cadherin) (Figure S1M). In mESCs cultured under pluripotency conditions, HTATSF1 was highly expressed (Figures 1I and S1K). Upon differentiation, HTATSF1 expression decreased transiently with lowest expression observed at 1 and 2 days EB differentiation (corresponding to 2 and 3 days after initiation of EB culture, see Figure 1H), a stage corresponding to the post-implantation epiblast (Figures 1I and S1K). When the cultures progressed further, HTATSF1 levels increased (Figures 1I and S1K). Thus, HTATSF1 shows a dynamic expression pattern with two peaks during naive pluripotency and neuroectoderm generation and low expression in the post-implantation epiblast. In hESCs, in contrast, HTATSF1 levels were low under pluripotency conditions and increased during neuroectoderm differentiation (Figure 1J), consistent with the fact that hESCs are similar to mouse post-implantation epiblast stem cells. We further asked whether loss of HTATSF1 was a general phenomenon during differentiation. We assessed expression of HTATSF1 and NANOG upon withdrawal of 2i/LIF. NANOG levels decreased 24 hr after 2i/LIF withdrawal (Figures S1H and S1J). Levels of HTATSF1 started to decrease at 24 hr and were low at 48 hr after 2i/LIF withdrawal (Figures S1H and S1I), indicating that loss of HTATSF1 is indeed a more general phenomenon observed upon exit from naive pluripotency."

            "content": "Our results showed that HTATSF1 is required for maintaining pluripotency in mESCs. HTATSF1 expression peaked not only during pluripotency, but also during neuroectoderm development. We therefore set out to prevent re-expression of HTATSF1 by deleting HTATSF1 at the stage that corresponds to the postimplantation epiblast characterized by low HTATSF1 expression (Figures 1I and S1K). We treated EBs with 4-OH-tamoxifen 24 hr after inducing EB formation, which results in HTATSF1 deletion from the EB 2-day time point, thus preventing re-expression of HTATSF1 (Figures 1H and S1L). Loss of HTATSF1 resulted in reduced expression of the neuroectoderm markers N-cadherin and Sox1 at the 5- and 7-day EB time point (Figure 1K). We also observed a failure to downregulate the pluripotency marker Oct4 upon loss of HTATSF1, while Sox2 levels were unchanged (Figure 1M). We further found that loss of HTATSF1 resulted in failure to downregulate formative pluripotency markers Otx2 and Oct6 as well as continued expression of the epiblast marker Fgf5 (Figure 1L). Taken together, loss of HTATSF1 results in a reduction of neuroectoderm marker expression and failure to downregulate markers of pluripotency, formative pluripotency, and epiblast, indicating that HTATSF1-deficient cells fail to effi- ciently differentiate toward neuroectoderm. To confirm these findings, we performed immunohistochemistry for the neuroectoderm marker SOX1. While immunohistochemistry of control EBs revealed an abundance of SOX1 positive cells, HTATSF1 KO EBs were mostly negative for SOX1 (Figures 1N and 1O), confirming that HTATSF1 is required for efficient neuroectoderm generation. We did not find differences in the generation of mesoderm and endoderm upon loss of HTATSF1 (Figures S1N-S1Q), indicating that HTATSF1 is not involved in these processes. We further asked whether failure to generate neuroectoderm was due to p53 induction. Deletion of HTATSF1 in Htatsf1 fl/fl ; CreERT2 +/ /C0 ; p53 /C0 / /C0 cells resulted in a failure to generate SOX1 positive neuroectoderm (Figures S2K-S2M), suggesting that p53 was not involved in the failure to generate neuroectoderm upon HTATSF1 loss."

            "content": "Our data show that differentiation of mESCs is characterized by a transient stage of low expression of HTATSF1. To test whether the decrease in HTATSF1 expression was a prerequisite for differentiation, we generated ESC lines stably overexpressing HTATSF1 (HTATSF1 OE). We analyzed wild-type (WT) and HTATSF1 OE EBs at the 7-day EB time point (Figures 1H and 2A-2D). While WT cells had lost expression of NANOG, indicating differentiation, cells overexpressing HTATSF1 retained NANOG expression, indicating failure to differentiate (Figures 2A and 2B). We further assessed neuroectoderm generation. WT EBs were positive for the neuroectoderm marker SOX1, while ESCs overexpressing HTATSF1 failed to induce SOX1, confirming that HTATSF1 OE cells did not differentiate into neuroectoderm (Figures 2C and 2D). We next tested differentiation toward endoderm and mesoderm. While WT EBs were positive for the endoderm marker SOX17 and the mesoderm marker BRACHYURY(T),cells overexpressing HTATSF1 failed to induce SOX17 or T, suggesting that overexpression of HTATSF1 prevented differentiation toward all three germ layers (Figures S3A-S3D). Thus, the transient downregulation of HTATSF1 observed upon exit from pluripotency is required for efficient mESCs differentiation."

            "content": "Our data suggest a role for HTATSF1 during naive mESC pluripotency and differentiation. We next asked whether HTATSF1 was involved in the establishment of primed EpiSCs from naive ESCs. EpiSCs expressed lower levels of HTATSF1 than naive ESCs (Figure S3E) and were characterized by high Fgf5 expression (Figure S3F). We tested the effects of forced HTATSF1 expression on the generation of EpiSCs from ESCs. While WT cells generated EpiSC colonies, HTATSF1 overexpression prevented generation of EpiSCs (Figures 2E and 2F), indicating that downregulation of HTATSF1 is crucial for the establishment\n\nof EpiSCs. Conversely, HTATSF1 overexpression in EpiSCs facilitated their conversion into reverted ESCs (rESCs) (Figure 2G). We next asked whether overexpression of HTATSF1 could enhance generation of human naive pluripotent stem cells. In hESCs, which express low levels of HTATSF1 (Figure 1J), expression of HTATSF1 together with either NANOG or KLF2 allowed the formation of AP positive colonies when cultured in 2i/LIF+Go \u00a8 (Takashima et al., 2014) (Figure 2H). To assess whether AP positive cells exhibited characteristics of naive pluripotent stem cells, we analyzed expression of naive pluripotency markers Tfcp2l1, Klf4, and Tbx3 (Figures 2I-2K). Cells expressing NANOG together with KLF2 expressed higher levels of naive pluripotency markers Tfcp2l1, Klf4, and Tbx3 than control H9 cells cultured under standard conditions. Levels of pluripotency markers Rex1, Nanog, and Oct4, which are not specific for naive pluripotency were only slightly changed (with the exception of Nanog in the NANOG overexpression conditions) (Figures S3G-S3I). Overexpression of NANOG resulted in slightly increased levels of Tfcp2l1 and increased levels of hTbx3 (Figures 2I and 2K). Although co-expression of HTATSF1 with NANOG resulted in only a slight increase of AP + colonies, we observed increased expression of the three markers for naive pluripotency Tfcp2l1, Klf4, and Tbx3 (Figures 2I-2K). These results indicate that HTATSF1 promotes a naive pluripotency like state in combination with NANOG; however, the effect on the efficiency of naive pluripotent stem cells generated (Figure 2H) is less pronounced compared to overexpression of the combination of KLF2 and NANOG. Taken together, HTATSF1 has a role in the generation of naive and primed pluripotency states in both human and mouse ESCs."

            "subtitle": "## HTATSF1 Controls Intron Retention in Ribosomal Protein Genes",
            "content": "Our results indicate that HTATSF1 is a regulator of ESC pluripotency and differentiation. To explore how HTATSF1 exerts these functions on a molecular level, we searched for its binding partners in mESCs. Using immunoprecipitation (IP) and mass spectrometry, we identified several splicing factors and proteins involved in ribosomal RNA transcription and processing as HTATSF1 interactors (Figure 3A; Table S1). HTATSF1 interacted with splicing factor SF3B1, a component of the U2 snRNP complex and with U2 snRNP complex member SF3B2 (Figures 3A and 3B; Table S1). Further, RNA IP followed by qRT-PCR analysis revealed binding of HTATSF1 to U2 snRNA (Figure 3C). Thus, our data confirm that HTATSF1 acts in the U2 snRNP complex (Fong and Zhou, 2001).\n\nTo identify potential roles for HTATSF1 in mRNA splicing, we performed RNA sequencing in control and HTATSF1 KO mESCs (Figure 3D; Table S2). We analyzed transcriptomes using two different algorithms to detect splicing defects. The analysis failed to find any evidence for alternative splice site usage or for exon skipping in HTATSF1 KO cells. However, both methods of analysis showed an increase of transcripts with retained introns at two time points (48 and 72 hr) after 4-OH-tamoxifen addition. Combining the overlap of both methods and manual confirmation led to the identification of 45 genes whose transcripts showed a significant increase in the retention of one or several introns (Table S2). We confirmed retained introns in Rpl36a , Eif1 , Eif3c , Rpl9, Rps20 , Rps18 , and Rpl7a by qRT-PCR and\n\nRT-PCR (Figures 3E, S4C, and S4D). Thus, our data suggest that HTATSF1 regulates the retention of a specific set of introns in ESCs.\n\nTo test whether the gene set affected by HTATSF1 loss correlates with a specific biological function, we used gene ontology (GO) term and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. Surprisingly, this analysis revealed a striking specificity for proteins involved in the regulation of protein translation. Proteins identified had known functions in ribosome biogenesis and assembly, including ribosomal proteins and translation initiation and elongation factors (Figure 3F; Table S2). We next analyzed sequence features of the introns affected by HTATSF1 loss. Retained introns were more GC rich (Figure 3G) and shorter (Figure 3H) than the genome-wide average and had a strong tendency to be the first intron within the transcript (39%) (Figure S4E). We also explored the consequences of HTATSF1-regulated intron retention. Sequence analysis of transcripts with retained introns revealed that most affected introns were in the coding region, although some were in the 5 0 UTR (Figure S4F). For all introns in the coding region, intron retention resulted in the generation of multiple STOP codons (Table S2). Accordingly, the protein levels of RPL36A, RPL7A, EIF3C, and EIF1 were significantly reduced in HTATSF1 KO ESCs (Figures 3I and 3J), indicating that retention of introns results in reduction of protein levels. Thus, HTATSF1 functions with the U2 snRNP complex to specifically mediate the removal of introns in ribosomal proteins and translation initiation factors to control their protein levels.\n\nHTATSF1 was described as a factor that stimulates general transcription elongation. Mass spectrometry revealed an association of HTATSF1 with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) subunit RPB1 (Table S1). Chromatin IP sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed only minor and few differences in Pol II traveling rates between control and HTATSF1 KO cells, indicating that stimulating transcriptional elongation might not be the major function of HTATSF1 in ESCs (Figures S4G and S4H). Since HTATSF1 interacted with SF3B1, a factor whose loss can cause intron retention phenotypes, we asked whether the intron retention observed upon loss of HTATSF1 was due to a reduction in SF3B1 levels (Figures S4A and S4B). We did not observe obvious changes in SF3B1 levels upon HTATSF1 KO, indicating that the intron retention phenotype was not mediated by reduced levels of SF3B1."

            "content": "In addition to the U2 snRNP complex, HTATSF1 interacted with proteins involved in rRNA transcription and processing (Figure 3A; Table S1). HTATSF1 was associated with the rRNA transcriptional regulators MYBBP1A (Hochstatter et al., 2012) and DDX21 (Calo et al., 2014), as well as nucleolar proteins UTP20, FIBRILLARIN, and large subunit biogenesis factors BOP1 and PES1. HTATSF1 was detected both in nuclear and nucleolar fractions in crosslinked samples (Figure S5A). We confirmed the interaction with large subunit biogenesis factors BOP1 and PES1 by Co-IP of crosslinked nuclear extracts (Figure S5B). We next asked whether HTATSF1 associated with rRNA transcripts. We performed RNA-IP from crosslinked nucleoli (Figure 4B). We found that HTATSF1 bound to the ITS2 site. Removal of the ITS2 is a prerequisite for the maturation of the 28S rRNA\n\n## Figure 3. HTATSF1 Functions in Splicing of Ribosomal Proteins\n\nand the 5.8S rRNA, which are part of the large ribosomal subunit (Figure 4A). We further analyzed levels of rRNA unprocessed transcripts and processed intermediates (Figure 4C). We observed reduction of 45S pre-rRNA levels upon HTATSF1 loss, suggesting a role in stimulation of rRNA transcription. HTATSF1 loss also resulted in an accumulation of unprocessed rRNA intermediates, most prominently in accumulation of unprocessed ITS2 containing intermediates, which underlines a role for HTATSF1 in processing of the large 60S ribosomal subunit rRNAs. Finally, ChIP-seq showed that HTATSF1 was bound predominantly to the rDNA promotor and the transcribed ribosomal protein abundance through control of intron retention in ribosomal protein mRNAs as well as ribosomal RNAs through its influence on ribosomal processing and transcription. At this point, it is unclear what part of the observed phenotypes on rRNA processing and transcription is due to a decrease in ribosomal proteins production caused by intron retention in ribosomal protein mRNAs (which predominantly affects large subunit ribosomal proteins) and what part of the phenotype is due to a direct influence of HTATSF1 on pre-rRNA transcription and processing. It might thus be possible that a large part of the observed phenotypes is due to the splicing function of\n\nHTATSF1rather than a direct interaction with the rRNA transcription and processing machinery."

We performed sucrose gradients followed by ri- bosomal fractionation to analyze ribosome abundance (Figures 4E and S5C-S5E). Whereas levels of the 40S subunit were similar in control and HTATSF1 KO cells lines, loss of HTATSF1 led to a decrease in the 60S ribosomal subunit and a reduction in polysome levels at 72 hr after 4-OH-tamoxifen treatment. At later time points, we also observed a reduction of the 80S peak (78 hr) and of the 60S, 40S, and 80S peaks (96 hr) (Figures S5C-S5E). These results indicate that HTATSF1 predominantly\n\nregulates 60S subunit maturation and polysome levels, but prolonged loss of HTATSF1 also affects levels of 40S and 80S. To further analyze whether HTATSF1 influences the levels of overall protein synthesis, we used O-propargyl-puromycin (OPP), a puromycin analog that generates covalent conjugates with nascent polypeptide chains. Indeed, levels of overall protein synthesis were significantly decreased upon loss of HTATSF1 (Figures 5A and 5B) confirming that HTATSF1 regulates protein synthesis levels."

We observed intron retention in HTATSF1-regulated introns of Rpl36a, Eif1, and Eif3c at the stage corresponding to the early post-implantation epiblast, where HTATSF1 expression was lowest. Overexpression of HTATSF1 abolished intron retention upon differentiation, confirming the role of HTATSF1 in intron removal (Figure 5D). In addition, EIF1, RPL7A, RPL36A, and RPS18 protein levels were high in ESCs, declined upon differentiation, and increased again in neuroectoderm (Figure 5E). Finally, OPP incorporation revealed that protein synthesis rates transiently declined in the post-implantation epiblast (Figure 5F). Taken together, our data reveal a striking correlation between HTATSF1 levels and intron retention, ribosomal protein levels, and protein translation rates in ESCs upon exit from pluripotency and differentiation into neuroectoderm.\n\nTo test the functional implications of this correlation, we attempted to rescue the HTATSF1 KO phenotype by increasing protein synthesis rates by deleting PTEN (Figure S6A) (Signer et al., 2014). Htatsf1 fl/fl ; CreERT2 +/ /C0 ; Pten /C0 / /C0 ; p53 /C0 / /C0 cells had increased levels of protein synthesis (Figure S6B). We asked whether PTEN deletion in a p53 /C0 / /C0 background could rescue the observed loss of pluripotency upon deletion of HTATSF1. Deletion of HTATSF1 in a p53 /C0 / /C0 , PTEN /C0 / /C0 background did not result in loss of NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2 (Figures 6A-6E, S6C, and S6D). In addition, loss of PTEN rescued the defect in colony-reforming efficiency observed upon loss of HTATSF1 (Figures 6F and 6G). We next assessed whether PTEN deletion could rescue failure to generate neuroectoderm upon deletion of HTATSF1 (Figure 6H). Loss of HTATSF1 prevented generation of SOX1 positive neuroectoderm in p53 /C0 / /C0 EBs (Figures S2L and S2M). Upon PTEN deletion, however, PTEN /C0 / /C0 , p53 /C0 / /C0 , and HTATSF1KOEBsgeneratedSOX1positiveneuroectoderm (Figures 6I and 6J). Thus, PTEN deletion can rescue the defects observed upon loss of HTATSF1 suggesting that HTATSF1 exerts its function by controlling rates of protein synthesis.\n\nSince loss of PTEN influences NANOG levels (Alva et al., 2011), weaskedwhether the rescue of the HTATSF1 KO phenotype was due to increased levels of NANOG. We overexpressed NANOG and analyzed colony-reforming efficiency upon HTATSF1 KO (Figures S6E-S6G). NANOG overexpression did not rescue the observed defect in colony-reforming efficiency, indicating that higher NANOG levels are not sufficient to rescue the HTATSF1 KOphenotype. Since PTEN also acts on AKT signaling, we asked whether loss of HTATSF1 resulted in reduced levels of AKT Ser473 phosphorylation. We did not detect reduced levels of AKT Ser473 upon loss of HTATSF1 (Figure S6H)."

            "content": "To test whether the effects seen in vitro also occur in vivo , we probed early mouse embryos for expression of HTATSF1 and levels of protein synthesis. Analysis of protein synthesis via OPP incorporation and immunostaining revealed that the E4.5 epiblast had high levels of both HTATSF1 and protein synthesis (Figures 7A-7C). During development, however, levels of HTATSF1 were decreased in E5.5 and E6.5 embryos and increased again in neuroectoderm at E7.5 (Figures 7A and 7B). Protein synthesis followed HTATSF1 expression dynamics, with decreased protein synthesis observed in the post-implantation epiblast at E6.5 and an increase at E7.5 (Figures 7A and 7C). Thus, the dynamics of protein synthesis and HTATSF1 expression in vivo resemble the dynamics observed in vitro in EBs. To study the effects of loss of HTATSF1 function during early embryogenesis, we employed in vitro ESC and TSC stem cell (ETS) embryo technology (Harrison et al., 2017), combining GFP-labeled trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) (Tanaka et al., 1998) with Htatsf1 fl/fl ; CreERT2 +/ /C0 ESCs. 4-OH-tamoxifen treatment deleted HTATSF1 specifically in the epiblast (Figures 7D and 7E). We first used the ETS embryo system to prevent upregulation of HTATSF1 in the post-implantation epiblast. We performed 4-OH-tamoxifen treatment 12 hr after mixing cell populations. Control ETS embryos progressed from the E4.75 stage (characterized by epiblast rosette formation) to the E5.0 stage (characterized by epiblast luminogenesis) to the E5.5 stage (characterized by trophoblast and epiblast luminogenesis) to the E5.75-E6.25 stage (characterized by proamniotic cavity fusion). Loss of HTATSF1 resulted in failure to undergo amniotic cavity fusion, indicating that HTATSF1 function is required for this process (Figure 7E). Exit from naive pluripotency is required for triggering amniotic cavity formation and developmental progression (Shahbazi et al., 2017). Accordingly, loss of the ability for cavity fusion as observed in HTATSF1 KO ETS embryos could potentially reflect failure to differentiate.\n\nWe further assessed loss of HTATSF1 during naive pluripotency in ETS embryos. We pre-treated ESCs with 4-OH-tamoxifen for 48 hr before ETS embryo generation and analyzed embryos at the time point corresponding to E4.75 (Figure S7A). While control ESCs were able to associate with TSCs to generate ETS embryos, HTATSF1 KO ESCs generated mixed aggregates with TSCs, which might indicate differentiation toward the trophoectoderm lineage, a phenotype previously described upon loss of OCT4 (Figures S7B and S7C) (Nichols et al., 1998). Taken together, these results indicate that HTATSF1 influences the regulation of morphogenesis and developmental progression during early embryonic development."
