    "opening": "## The mitochondrial mRNA-stabilizing protein SLIRP regulates skeletal muscle mitochondrial structure and respiration by exercise-recoverable mechanisms\n\nDecline in mitochondrial function is linked to decreased muscle mass and strength in conditions like sarcopenia and type 2 diabetes. Despite therapeutic opportunities, there is limited and equivocal data regarding molecular cues controlling muscle mitochondrial plasticity. Here we uncovered that the mitochondrial mRNA-stabilizing protein SLIRP, in complex with LRPPRC, is a PGC-1 \u03b1 target that regulates mitochondrial structure, respiration, and mtDNAencoded-mRNA pools in skeletal muscle. Exercise training effectively counteracts mitochondrial defects caused by genetically-induced LRPPRC/SLIRP loss, despite sustained low mtDNA-encoded-mRNA pools, by increasing mitoribosome translation capacity and mitochondrial quality control. In humans, exercise training robustly increases muscle SLIRP and LRPPRC protein across exercise modalities and sexes, yet less prominently in individuals with type 2 diabetes. SLIRP muscle loss reduces Drosophila lifespan. Our data points to a mechanism of post-transcriptional mitochondrial regulation in muscle via mitochondrial mRNA stabilization, offering insights into how exercise enhances mitoribosome capacity and mitochondrial quality control to alleviate defects.\n\nMitochondrial homeostasis and function are vital for skeletal muscle physiology, primarily in /uniFB02 uenced by the ability to meet energy demands through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in mitochondria 1 . A decline in mitochondrial function is associated with decreased muscle mass and strength in multiple conditions, including sarcopenia, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and cancer. Reduced muscle function adversely impacts health and quality of life 1 -9 and is associated with increased all-cause mortality. Mounting evidence suggests that improvements in mitochondrial metabolism contribute to the exercise-induced functional bene /uniFB01 ts, as mitochondrial preservation protects against the age-associated decline in skeletal muscle mass and performance 10,11 . The bene /uniFB01 cial effects of exercise training are more potent than any drug in preserving muscle mass and function, positioning exercise training as a frontline strategy for the prevention and\n\ntreatment of sarcopenia, T2D, and cancer 12 -14 . Viewing mitochondrial control through the lens of exercise biology is a strategy to gain new mechanistic insights into mitochondrial regulation, which is currently incompletely understood. With an aging population and no FDA/EMAapproved drugs to treat muscle functional decline, there is an urgent unmet need to identify potential treatment targets.\n\nOXPHOS proteins are of dual origin and transcribed in spatially distinct cellular compartments. Nuclear (n)DNA encodes for the majority of OXPHOS proteins. Yet, 13 essential OXPHOS proteins are encoded by the small circular high-copy number mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 15,16 . In non-muscle systems, a protein complex comprised of steroid receptor RNA activator stem-loop interacting RNA-binding protein (SLIRP) and the leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat containing protein (LRPPRC) mediates mitochondrial-mRNA (mt-mRNA)\n\nstability and polyadenylation of most mtDNA-encoded OXPHOS transcripts 17 -21 . SLIRP and LRPPRC, encoded by nuclear DNA, are primarily targeted to mitochondria. In addition, SLIRP may also regulate nuclear receptors by binding to steroid receptor RNA activator 22 , and LRPPRCmayactivate nuclear genes through interaction with PGC-1 \u03b1 23 . Stabilization of mt-mRNA is critical for protein synthesis by the mitochondrial ribosome (mitoribosome). Yet, the mitoribosome comprises 82 mitoribosomal proteins encoded by nuclear genes, and 12S and 16S rRNAs, highlighting the requirement for intricate coordination between the processes of cytosolic and mitochondrial protein synthesis 18,19 .\n\nDespite the high mitochondrial abundance in skeletal muscle, the complex interaction between LRPPRC/SLIRP-mediated posttranscriptional processes, mitoribosomal translation, and mitochondrial function has not previously been studied in skeletal muscle. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms for stabilizing mt-mRNA could not only facilitate our understanding of the fundamental energy metabolism in muscle, but also aid intervention strategies for diseases associated with skeletal muscle mitochondrial defects.\n\nEndurance exercise training potently increases mitochondrial massinskeletalmuscle, inpartdue to the increased synthesis of nDNA -and mtDNA -encoded mitochondrial proteins 1,24 . Importantly, exercise training retains its ability to improve oxidative capacity not only in healthy individuals but also in patients with mtDNA mutations, with common PGC-1 \u03b1 -mediated mitochondrial adaptive responses shared between both groups 13 . These results suggest that exercise training induces adaptations to reinforce the mitochondria ' s ability to ef /uniFB01 -ciently respond to increased energy demands, even in the presence of mtDNA mutations, which may negatively affect mitochondrial transcription and translation. However, a notable knowledge gap persists in understanding the role of mitochondrial posttranscriptional processes, speci /uniFB01 cally in mt-mRNA stabilization and translation, in skeletal muscle biology and following exercise training. Yet, that knowledge is needed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the adaptive responses to exercise training.\n\nSince SLIRP, a key player in mitochondrial posttranscriptional gene expression, is markedly upregulated in mouse skeletal muscle by exercise training 25 , we hypothesized that SLIRP would regulate mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle at rest and in response to exercise training. Our /uniFB01 ndings illuminate SLIRP\u00b4s role in regulating mtmRNA transcript levels in skeletal muscle, downstream of PGC-1 \u03b1 1. Knockout(KO)ofSLIRPledtodamagedandfragmentedmitochondria alongside lowered respiration. Intriguingly, exercise training could compensate for the absence of SLIRP, leading to improvements in mitochondrial integrity and respiratory capacity. Our /uniFB01 ndings imply the activation of complex exercise-induced molecular signaling in skeletal muscle which bypasses mt-mRNA defects, possibly through enhanced mitoribosomal translation and capacity of mitochondrial quality control.\n",

            "content": "Protein pro /uniFB01 ling of /uniFB01 ve different skeletal muscle tissues showed that SLIRP content was highest in the oxidative soleus compared to glycolytic extensor digitorum longus (EDL, Fig. 1A, Supplementary Fig. 1A), in accordance with the potential critical role for SLIRP in oxidation. Moreover, SLIRP was present across a diverse array of tissues in mice and was highly abundant in energy-demanding tissues such as liver, kidney, brown adipose tissue, heart, and skeletal muscle (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Fig. 1A), in line with previously reported Slirp mRNA levels 22 .\n\nIn skeletal muscle of global Slirp KO mice, SLIRP protein was undetectable. Moreover, SLIRP\u00b4s binding partner LRPPRC showed 90% reduction in protein content (Fig. 1B), indicative of their costabilization. To con /uniFB01 rm co-stabilization, we administered intramuscular injections of recombinant adeno-associated viral serotype 6 (rAAV6): Slirp into the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of wild-type (WT) mice, while injecting a control vector into the contralateral TA muscle. As expected, in the absence of injecting vectors to concomitantly upregulate LRPPRC, total SLIRP protein content did not increase because endogenous SLIRP protein was degraded (Fig. 1C). These /uniFB01 ndings show that SLIRP and LRPPRC stabilize each other in skeletal muscle, aligning with /uniFB01 ndings from non-muscle tissue 17,18,20 .\n\nWenext determined the role of SLIRP for mitochondrial structure in skeletal muscle, using the membrane potential probe, tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE+), in intact /uniFB02 exor digitorum brevis (FDB) muscle /uniFB01 bers of Slirp KOand littermate control wild-type (WT) mice. Interestingly, the /uniFB01 nely interconnected mitochondrial network, obvious in WT /uniFB01 bers, was disrupted in Slirp KOmuscle /uniFB01 bers, evident by a 30% increased mitochondrial fragmentation index (Fig. 1D). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of gastrocnemius muscle provided further insights into the ultrastructural changes of mitochondrial morphology in Slirp KO (Fig. 1E). Half of the Slirp KO gastrocnemius muscles displayed reduced density of the matrix, disarray of the cristae, and substantial enlargement and vacuolation of intermyo /uniFB01 brillar (IMF) mitochondria (Fig. 1E). Quantitative analysis of the mitochondria showed that the percentage of damaged IMF mitochondria was increased (Fig. 1F). However, there werenosigni /uniFB01 cant alterations in the total number of IMF mitochondria (Fig. 1G). The percentage of damaged mitochondria in Slirp KOmuscle varied between 2 -20% of total mitochondria compared to &lt;2% of damaged mitochondria in WT muscle (Fig. 1E, F). Other structural parameters of IMF mitochondria, such as mitochondrial area, aspect ratio, elongation, convexity, perimeter, sphericity, and diameter did not display any signi /uniFB01 cant changes in Slirp KO muscles, likely due to heterogeneity in the extent of damage (Fig. 1F, Supplementary Fig. 1B -H).\n\nIn agreement with the observable abnormalities in mitochondrial structure, respiratory capacity was reduced in permeabilized gastrocnemius muscle /uniFB01 bers of Slirp KOmicecomparedto WT (Fig. 1H). This was particularly evident when adding glutamate to assess complex I linked respiratory activity ( -24%) and succinate to assess complex I + II linked respiratory capacity ( -21%). These results indicate an important role for SLIRP selectively in skeletal muscle respiration, as in isolated mitochondria from liver and heart tissues, Slirp KO did not compromise mitochondrial respiration 18 . In agreement with lower respiration, fatty acid oxidation tended ( p =0.0718) to be lower in intact incubated soleus muscle of Slirp KO mice (Fig. 1I). However, electrically-induced muscle contraction increased fatty acid oxidation similarly in both genotypes, suggesting that fatty acid utilization for fuel during muscle contraction does not depend on SLIRP (Fig. 1I).\n\nWith the suggested role of SLIRP as an mt-mRNA stabilizing protein in non-muscle cells 18 , we determined mtDNA-encoded mRNA transcripts. Intriguingly, we observed a 60 -80% reduction in mt-Nd1 , mt-Nd5/Nd6 (Complex I), mt-CytB (Complex III), mt-Co1 (Complex IV), and mt-Atp6 (ATP synthase) in gastrocnemius muscle (Fig. 1J) with concomitant reductions in protein content for MTCO1 and MTATP6. Additionally, there was an increased mtDNA copy number, estimated by measuring Nd1 and Nd6 (Fig. 1K). Those results indicate that SLIRP stabilizes mt-mRNA, and its loss adversely affects MTCO1 and MTATP6 protein content in skeletal muscle.\n\nTogether, these results suggest that mt-mRNA stabilization via SLIRP is required for proper mitochondrial network structure and morphology, and respiration in mouse muscle."

            "content": "Having established critical functional roles of SLIRP in skeletal muscle mitochondrial morphology and respiratory capacity with detrimental effects on lifespan, we next investigated the upstream regulation of SLIRP protein content. Our recent work pinpointed SLIRP as a protein responsive to exercise training 25 ; yet the mechanisms governing its induction and functions remained elusive. Knowing that exercise potently increases PGC-1 \u03b1 protein and mRNA levels in both mouse and human skeletal muscle 31 -34 , and that PGC-1 \u03b1 is an important regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, respiration, and quality control 35 , we explored the regulation of SLIRP by PGC-1 \u03b1 . The Ppargc1a gene encodes several PGC-1 \u03b1 isoforms, including isoform 1 (PGC-1 \u03b1 1) and isoform 4 (PGC-1 \u03b1 4), with distinct regulation and biological functions 36,37 . Overexpression (OE) of PGC-1 \u03b1 1 in mouse skeletal muscle 36,38 , associating with endurance exercise training-like adaptations 36,38,39 , resulted in approximately 8.3-fold higher muscle SLIRP protein content, without a concomitant change in Slirp mRNA levels (Fig. 2A). On the contrary, PGC-1 \u03b1 4 OE 40 , inducing resistancetype exercise training adaptations such as muscle hypertrophy and strength 36 , had no effect on SLIRP protein content in mouse gastrocnemius muscle (Fig. 2B). This suggests that SLIRP is an unrecognized player in PGC-1 \u03b1 1-regulated oxidative metabolism.\n\nTo test whether PGC-1 \u03b1 regulates Slirp mRNA in skeletal muscle following exercise, we determined Slirp and Ppargc1a (Exon 3 -5) mRNAlevels in TA muscle 3 h into recovery from one exercise bout in mice lacking PGC-1 \u03b1 in skeletal muscle (PGC-1 \u03b1 mKO) and WT control littermates. Slirp mRNA was not upregulated 3 h post-exercise (Fig. 2C), in contrast to the expected 34 increase in Ppargc1a (+6.8fold; Fig. 2C) in WT mice. Interestingly, Slirp mRNA levels were only modestly 14% reduced in PGC-1 \u03b1 KO skeletal muscle (Fig. 2C), in line with the dissociation between Slirp mRNA levels and SLIRP protein levels observed in PGC-1 \u03b1 1 OE skeletal muscle (Fig. 2A).\n\nThese /uniFB01 ndings align with reports describing only moderate correlations between mRNA and protein levels following exercise 41 -43 . Yet, with the interpretative limitations of a single post-exercise time point, weaimedtoacquire a more detailed record of the temporal changes in Slirp transcripts in recovery from exercise.

We found that Slirp mRNA levels were 1.4-fold elevated 6 h into the recovery period in quadriceps muscle (Fig. 2D). This is a time-point not included in our prior cohort (Fig. 2C), and partially concurrent with Ppargc1a mRNAlevels that were elevated 2 h (+3.0-fold) and 6 h post-exercise (+ 3.3-fold; Fig. 2D). Concomitant with Slirp and Ppargc1a mRNA levels, mtDNA-encoded mt-Nd1 mRNA transcripts were increased 1.5-fold 6 h post-exercise, but not mt-Cox1 , mt-Cox2 , and mt-Atp6 (Fig. 2E). These results indicate a coordinated regulatory mechanism linking SLIRP, PGC-1a and the simultaneous upregulation of mt-Nd1 mRNA transcripts.\n\nSince SLIRP is a nuclear-encoded protein primarily targeted to mitochondria by a speci /uniFB01 c signal sequence, we next determined if muscle contractions increased the mitochondrial localization of SLIRP in cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions. To investigate this, we investigated quadriceps muscles from WT mice 2 h after electricallyinduced in situ contraction, using the contralateral leg muscle as a rested control, and performed an adapted subcellular fractionation assay on frozen tissue 44,45 to isolate cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions. COX4 protein was used as mitochondrial marker, and GAPDH as cytosolic marker, respectively, to assess the purity of the fractions.\n\nOnawhole-tissue lysate level, SLIRP protein remained unchanged in response to contraction (Fig. 2F). SLIRP protein content tended to be 1.2-fold and 1.3-fold enriched in the cytosolic and mitochondrial fraction, respectively, following in situ muscle contraction (Fig. 2F), indicating that muscle contractions increase protein synthesis in the cytosolic and mitochondrial localization of SLIRP. Interestingly, and withthesamesampleinput,wewereabletodetectSLIRPproteininthe cytosolic fraction, indicating that SLIRP may not be exclusive to mitochondria in skeletal muscle. These data suggest that muscle contraction elicits a subcellular redistribution of SLIRP towards the mitochondria.\n\nGiven that SLIRP might be regulated by PGC-1 \u03b1 , we next turned to investigate the long-term dependency of exercise training-induced regulation of SLIRP protein by PGC-1 \u03b1 . In contrast to acute exercise, exercise training increased SLIRP protein content 4.8-fold in WT mice (Fig. 2G), recapitulating our earlier observations in mice engaged in voluntary wheel running 25 . The effect of exercise training on SLIRP protein content was markedly blunted by 70% in mice lacking PGC-1 \u03b1 in muscle compared to trained WT mice (Fig. 2G). Expectedly, in WT mice, exercise training potently upregulated the steady-state levels of multiple OXPHOS proteins including SDHB, UQCRC2, and MTCO1 in skeletal muscle (Supplementary Fig. 1I -K). In mice lacking PGC-1 \u03b1 in muscle, SDHB (Supplementary Fig. 1I) and MTCO1 protein (Supplementary Fig. 1K) was 50 -60% reduced in sedentary (SED) mice.\n\nMoreover, the effect of exercise training on SDHB (Supplementary Fig. 1I) and UQCRC2 protein content (Supplementary Fig. 1J) was blunted by30%and65%,respectively, in PGC-1 \u03b1 mKOcomparedtoWT mice.

To this end, we conducted a 10-week voluntary wheel-running training study in Slirp KOandWTlittermate miceof both sexes commencing at ~18 weeks of age. The experimental design is shown in Fig. 3A.\n\nThe daily running distance recorded over 6 weeks of the 10-week study was 2.4 km/day on average for male mice of both genotypes, whereas it was 4.8 km/day for female exercise-trained (ET) WT mice and 3.0 km/day for female KO ET mice (Fig. 3B). It is important to consider that the running distance observed in our study of 18-week old mice is shorter than those reported in other exercise training studies using ~ 10-week-old mice, which typically run 6 -8km/day on average 25,50,51 . Despite the higher food intake in ET mice (Fig. 3C), exercise training lowered body weight in both trained genotypes (Supplementary Fig. 2A). Moreover, irrespective of genotype, exercise training reduced fat mass/body weight ratio (Supplementary Fig. 2B) and increased lean mass/body weight ratio compared to sedentary (SED) groups (Supplementary Fig. 2C). Exercise training had no effect on gastrocnemius or TA muscle weight relative to tibia length in either sex (Supplementary Fig. 2D). However, we noted that female Slirp KO SED and both ET groups had elevated heart weight relative to WT SED (Supplementary Fig. 2D).\n\nExercise capacity increased similarly with exercise training, independently of genotype (+ 1.2-fold for WT ET, +1.3-fold for KO ET; Supplementary Fig. 2E) and sex (females shown in Supplementary Fig. 2G). Post-exercise blood lactate levels tended to be reduced (-1.7fold; p =0.067) by ET in WT male mice (Supplementary Fig. 2F). The training-induced lowering of blood lactate post-exercise was absent in male and female Slirp KO mice (Supplementary Fig. 2F, H).\n\nExercise training is a powerful preventative intervention against many metabolic disorders 12 , partially due to its remarkable effects in improving glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity documented in both animal models and humans 25,50,52 . Accordingly, male WT ET mice displayed reduced fasting blood glucose (Fig. 3D) and improved blood glucose control evidenced by a downshifted glucose response curve compared to WT SED mice. This effect was not observed in trained male Slirp KO mice (Fig. 3E). Thus, trained Slirp KO mice displayed similar glucose tolerance as both SED groups. The incremental area under the curve (iAUC) of blood glucose was similar between groups (Fig. 3F), suggesting that the lowered plasma glucose excursion during the GTT was driven by lower basal glucose levels. Yet, exercise training reduced the levels of plasma insulin in both WT and Slirp KO mice, suggesting that insulin sensitivity was increased by exercise training in both groups (Fig. 3G). There was no effect of exercise training or genotype on fasting glucose, glucose tolerance or insulin levels in female mice (Fig. 3H -K).\n\nOur results demonstrate that SLIRP is largely dispensable for organismal adaptations to exercise training, yet, in male mice SLIRP is required for training-induced improvement in blood glucose regulation."

We primarily focused our analyses on male mice, as our /uniFB01 ndings revealed a stronger propensity for adaptive response to exercise training in male Slirp KOmice.Thecorresponding analyses for female mice are included in Supplementary Fig. 3.\n\nFirst, we veri /uniFB01 ed that both SLIRP (+ 1.2-fold) and concomitantly LRPPRC (+ 1.4-fold) were upregulated by exercise training in the gastrocnemius muscle in WT, but not Slirp KO mice (Fig. 4C). These /uniFB01 ndings reinforce the co-stabilizing relationship of SLIRP and LRPPRC not only at sedentary 17,18,20,58 but also during exercise trained conditions.\n\nSLIRP, together with LRPPRC, has been shown to maintain mtmRNA stability and aid mitoribosomal translation in non-muscle tissues 17 -20,58 . Indeed, the marked downregulation of mt-mRNA transcripts in SED Slirp KO muscle, also shown in Fig. 1J, remained largely reduced in ET Slirp KO mice relative to WT ET mice (Fig. 4E). Visually, there appeared to be a partial rescue of mt-Nd5/6 and mt-Co1 in ET Slirp KO mice, though this observation was not statistically con /uniFB01 rmed. The sustained reduction in mt-mRNA transcripts upon Slirp KOis clearer in female mice, where exercise training signi /uniFB01 cantly increased mt-mRNA transcript levels in WT mice, a response completely abrogated in Slirp KO mice (Supplementary Fig. 3B). The differences in mt-mRNA transcript levels in response to exercise training between sexes are likely due to the variation in running volume, with female WT mice running twice as much as male WT mice (4.8 km/day vs. 2.4 km/day; Fig. 3B). In contrast, mtDNA copy number, measured using quantitative PCR and primers for mtNd1 (Supplementary Fig. 2J) or mt-Nd5/mt-Nd6 (Supplementary Fig. 2K), were unaltered across groups or elevated only in Slirp KOSEDmice.Thissuggests a compensatory response to mitigate muscle mitochondrial defects by increasing mtDNA copy number 59 or decreasing its degradation. Accordingly, these /uniFB01 ndings suggests that SLIRP is crucial for mitochondrial transcript stability in skeletal muscle. We were intrigued to /uniFB01 nd that exercise training still restored protein content of mtDNA-encoded OXPHOS subunits, MT-ND3, MT-CO1 and MT-ATP6 in Slirp KOmice (Fig. 4F). Thus, exercise training completely counteracted the sustained reduction in the mt-mRNA levels of these proteins in Slirp KO ET mice. Interestingly, exercise training markedly upregulated nuclear-encoded OXPHOS subunits SDHB (Complex II) and ATP5A (ATPase complex, also known as complex V) protein content in Slirp KO mice, both 1.4-fold more than in the trained WT mice (Fig. 4G). Other nuclear-encoded OXPHOS subunits, such as NDUFB8 (Complex I) and UQCRC2 (Complex III) also upregulated by exercise training (Fig. 4G, representative blots shown in Fig. 4I). Intriguingly, the trained Slirp KO mice had a more pronounced increase in all\n\nOXPHOSprotein content in response to exercise training compared to the WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 4A -G), suggesting a stronger propensity for adaptive responses to exercise training due to loss of SLIRP. Mitonuclear imbalance in Slirp KO mice also appeared to be restored by exercise training (Fig. 4H), evaluated by determining the ratio between mtDNA- (MTCO1) and nDNA-encoded (ATP5A) OXPHOS proteins 60 . Citrate synthase (CS) activity correlates with mitochondrial content in human 61 and mouse skeletal muscle 62 . CS activity, indicative of mitochondrial content, was increased similarly in Slirp KO and WT\n\nmice after exercise training (Supplementary Fig. 2L), suggesting that improvements in mitochondrial content following exercise training are independent of SLIRP.\n\nThese results underline a substantial skeletal muscle mitochondrial plasticity, which is retained despite a 60 -80% reduction in mt-mRNA pools.

We observed training-induced increases in 12S ribosomal RNA (12S rRNA), 16S ribosomal rRNA (16S rRNA, Fig. 5B) and several mitoribosomal proteins, essential components of mitoribosome translation 63,64 (MRPL11, MRPL12, MRPS18B, MRPS35, Fig. 5C). MRPL11, MRPL12, MRPS18B protein content was 86%, 59%, and 48%, respectively, more elevated in response to exercise training in Slirp KO than WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 4H -J). Exercise training increased cytosolic ribosomal protein S6 protein content 68% in WT mice and 34% in Slirp KO mice (rpS6, Fig. 5C; representative blots in Fig. 4L).\n\nGiven the predominant impact of Slirp KO on mitochondria, training-induced adaptive changes might also manifest directly within the affected cellular compartment. Here, we investigated mitochondrial quality control systems involving the mitochondrial Lon protease 1 (LONP1), YME1-like ATPase (YME1L1), the p-eIF2 \u03b1 -ATF4 -CHOPaxis 65 , and PRDX3.\n\nLONP1 and YME1L1 are the frontline defense against mitochondrial damage and remove accumulated unfolded or damaged proteins 66 . Exercise training increased both LONP1 and YME1L1 protein content (Fig. 5E, F), with a 1.7-fold greater response in Slirp KO mice (Supplementary Fig. 4K), suggesting an enhanced mitochondrial quality control induced by exercise training that is augmented in Slirp KO muscles with low mt-mRNA levels.\n\nRecent research identi /uniFB01 es mitochondrial damage as a key activator of the p-eIF2 \u03b1 -ATF4 -CHOP axis, known as integrated stress response (ISR) 65,66 . Since ISR is involved in mitochondrial quality control, we measured EIF2 \u03b1 phosphorylation at S51 to investigate the impact of SLIRP loss and exercise training on ISR. The loss of SLIRP tended to increase p-EIF2 \u03b1 1.4-fold, indicating the potential presence of mitochondrial damage. Intriguingly, exercise training markedly reduced phospho-EIF2 \u03b1 by 58% selectively in Slirp KOmice, and below the level of WT SED and WT ET mice. As exercise training had no such effect in the WT mice (Fig. 5G, Supplementary Fig. 4L), exercise training may reduce phospho-EIF2 \u03b1 speci /uniFB01 cally in the context of mitochondrial damage induced by SLIRP loss to promote protein translation.\n\nAnother mitochondrial quality control system involves a mitochondrial scavenger enzyme, peroxiredoxin 3 (PRDX3). PRDX3 plays a role in balancing redox environment speci /uniFB01 cally in mitochondria 67,68 , possibly contributing to the preservation of factors critical for translation during conditions of mitochondrial dysfunction and exercise training. Interestingly, PRDX3 protein content was 50% lower in Slirp KOSEDcomparedtoWTSEDmice,indicativeofalowermitochondrial\n\nDNA-encoded oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) proteins analysed.

This was restored by exercise training, bringing PRDX3 up to levels observed in trained WTmice (Fig. 5I). We further noted that ET lowered the PRDX3 dimer to monomer ratio in both genotypes, indicative of a lower basal mitochondrial-derived peroxide accumulation likely due to an enhancement of scavenger activity (Fig. 5J). The cytosolic peroxidoxin 2 (PRDX2) was unaffected by genotype and exercise training (Fig. 5K, representative blots in Fig. 5L).\n\nCollectively, our /uniFB01 ndings indicate a complex interplay of spatially distinct molecular muscle adaptations in response to Slirp KO and ET. Our /uniFB01 ndings suggest that exercise training induces mechanisms to increase mitochondrial protein synthesis capacity and improve mitochondrial quality control. Speci /uniFB01 cally, exercise training elevated mitoribosome mass and restored mitochondrial quality control to powerfully circumvent the Slirp KO-induced depletion of mtDNAencoded transcript levels."

            "content": "Our intriguing results from mouse and /uniFB02 y models prompted us to test whether our results provide translational value for humans in health and disease. SLIRP and LRPPRC protein content were determined in human skeletal muscle in four independent exercise cohorts employing different exercise modalities in conjunction with or without aging or diabetes and in males and females. Participant characteristics and study designs for the different ET modalities have been published previously for all the clinical studies 69 -72 .\n\nSkeletal muscle SLIRP and LRPPRC protein abundances were 70% increased following 14-weeks of controlled and supervised aerobic and strength exercise training intervention in healthy young women 69 (Fig. 6A). Also, a 6-week high-intensity interval training (HIIT) intervention elevated muscle protein content of SLIRP (+ 80%, Fig. 6B) and LRPPRC (+ 50%, Fig. 6B) in healthy young men 72 . Thus, the exercise training response of SLIRP and LRPPRC was highly consistent, independent of sex, and responsive to various exercise modalities. The 12week progressive resistance exercise training 70 increased SLIRP and LRPPRC muscle protein content in the entire group of young and old individuals but had no signi /uniFB01 cant effect on LRPPRC abundance in neither young nor elderly subjects separately (Fig. 6C). The mtDNAencoded transcript levels of MT-ND6 , MT-CYB , MT-CO1 and MT-ATP6 were comparable across all groups (Fig. 6D), indicating that mitochondrial gene expression was not signi /uniFB01 cantly affected by either aging or the training regimen in this study at the time of sampling. Similarly to our observations in mice, we observed a marked 1.9 and 2.3-fold increase in MRPL11 in elderly and young individuals, respectively (Fig. 6E; representative blot in Fig. 6C), supporting that the increase in mitoribosomal biogenesis and mitochondrial translation capacity in response to exercise training is conserved in humans 42 .\n\nExercise training-mediated improvements in muscle mitochondrial content and function may be associated with improved glucose\n\nmetabolism in individuals with obesity and T2D 73,74 , although this association is not always clear 75 . The training response of muscle SLIRP and LRPPRC to 8-weeks HIIT was conserved in individuals who were lean (+ 150% and +54%) or obese (+ 85% and +45%, Fig. 6F). However,\n\nthe exercise response for LRPPRC, but not SLIRP, was blunted in muscle of patients with T2D in comparison to lean individuals (Fig. 6F), suggesting impaired sensitivity of muscle to some mitochondrial adaptations to ET in T2D. At the mRNA level, mt-DNA encoded\n\nTogether, we show that SLIRP and LRPPRC are robustly upregulated in skeletal muscle across various exercise training modalities in\n\nmen and women, lean and obese. However, the exercise training response of LRPPRC was blunted in patients with T2D. This suggests that T2D is associated with decreased sensitivity to some of the adaptive mitochondrial responses normally elicited by exercise training, possibly in /uniFB02 uenced by exercise intensity or volume. Thus, our clinical data in humans provide strong translational value of the SLIRPde /uniFB01 cient /uniFB02 y and mouse models and point towards a conserved requirement of SLIRP for skeletal muscle health, and potentially the SLIRP-independent mechanisms that compensate during exercise training."
