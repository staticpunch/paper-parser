Here, we identify the multidomain RNA-binding protein FUBP1 as a key splicing factor that binds to a hitherto unknown cisregulatory motif. By collecting NMR, structural, and in vivo interaction data, we demonstrate that FUBP1 stabilizes U2AF2 and SF1, key components at the 3 0 splice site, through multivalent binding interfaces located within its disordered regions. Transcriptional profiling and kinetic modeling reveal that FUBP1 is required for efficient splicing of long introns, which is impaired in cancer patients harboring FUBP1 mutations. Notably, FUBP1 interacts with numerous U1 snRNP-associated proteins, suggesting a unique role for FUBP1 in splice site bridging for long introns. We propose a compelling model for 3 0 splice site recognition of long introns, which represent 80% of all human introns.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nSplicing is a crucial step in eukaryotic mRNA processing, and its dysregulation is a hallmark of many cancers. 1-3 Splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a megadalton machinery comprising five small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complexes named U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6. 4-7 During early spliceosome assembly (E complex formation), the 5 0 and 3 0 splice sites are recognized: U1 binds at the 5 0 splice site, whereas U2 auxiliary factor 1 (U2AF1), U2AF2, and splicing factor 1 (SF1) assemble at the 3 0 splice site, 6-11 where they specifically recognize AG dinucleo-\n\ntide, 12,13 polypyrimidine (Py) tract, 14-16 and branch point (BP) site, respectively (Figure 1A). 9,17 In the resulting A complex, U2 snRNP is recruited to the BP and stabilized by SF3A and SF3B, and SF1 is released. 18,19 Subsequent snRNP recruitment and further rearrangements (formation of B and C complexes) mediate intron excision and exon ligation to form the mature mRNA.\n\nStrikingly, mechanistic details of splice site recognition by multidomain splicing factors during early spliceosome assembly are lacking. 20,21 U2AF2 binding is central to the early definition of splice sites and is subject to layers of regulation including direct\n\ncompetition, cooperative recruitment, change of RNA secondary structure, dynamic conformational states, and autoinhibition. 15,22-30 Despite the pivotal role of U2AF2, the precise contribution of cofactors and multivalent interactions are yet to be elucidated. Recently, we reported how U2AF2 achieves specificity despite the degeneracy of its pyrimidine-rich RNA-binding motif. 28 In this study, we found that the RNA-binding protein (RBP) far upstream binding protein 1 (FUBP1) promotes U2AF2 binding to RNA.\n\nFUBP1wasinitially characterized as a transcriptional regulator of the proto-oncogene c -myc through binding to AT-rich DNA elements and interaction with PUF60, also known as the FUBP-interacting repressor (FIR). 31-34 However, more recently, FUBP1 has also been reported to bind RNA and to influence translation or splicing of specific transcripts. 35-38 Similar to its DNA-binding specificity, FUBP1 exhibits a general preference for AU- and GU-rich RNA 31 that is expected to derive from its four K homology (KH) domains. 39 Notably, cancer-associated\n\nloss-of-function mutations within FUBP1 have been connected to global splicing changes in low-grade glioma, 1,40-42 suggesting an RNA-regulatory role in these processes. Here, we reveal a global role for FUBP1 in pre-mRNA splicing. Our results suggest that FUBP1 functions as a general splicing factor at the 3 0 splice site, with a crucial role in promoting efficient splicing of long introns, which make up over 80% of human pre-mRNA transcripts.\n",

            "content": "Todissect the role of FUBP1 in splicing, we examined the footprint of FUBP1 and other splicing factors on pre-mRNA in HeLa cells using in vivo individual-nucleotide resolution UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation ( in vivo iCLIP; Figures 1B and S1A; Table S1). 43,44 As expected, large proportions of the binding sites of SF1, U2AF2, and SF3B1 are located at 3 0 splice sites (10%, 17%, and 22%, respectively). Interestingly, FUBP1 shows a similar preference for 3 0 splice sites (19%). By contrast, for the more restricted splicing regulator PTBP1, which is known to act on a subset of exons, only 1% of binding sites are located at 3 0 splice sites. We confirmedthat U2AF2 binds atthe Pytractlocated betweentheBPand3 0 splice site, 45,46 whereasSF1bindingpeaks at the BP, with a reduced signal at the BP adenine itself, 9,17 presumably owing to the lower cross-linking efficiency of adenine (Figures 1C and 1D). 47 Consistent with a previous report, 48 SF3B1 binds in a clamp-wise manner up- and downstream of the BP. Strikingly, FUBP1 also shows a pronounced footprint at the BP (Figures 1C and 1D). Its binding peaks at a location 34 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the BP and tails for up to 100 nt. In comparison, PTBP1 does not display such a ubiquitous positioning at 3 0 splice sites (Figure 1C). 49,50 Next, weaddressedwhatfractionof 3 0 splice sites is bound using a saturation-based analysis that controls for splice site usage and transcript abundance. 51 We found that FUBP1 binds the same percentage of 3 0 splice sites as U2AF2 and SF3B1, which are both universally present at 3 0 splice sites (91.3%, 95.4%, and 99.6%, respectively; Figure 1E). By contrast, SF1 and PTBP1 are associated with 27.3% and 3.1% of 3 0 splice sites, respectively (Figures 1E and S1B). Overall, these data suggest that FUBP1 functions as a general splicing factor in early spliceosome assembly."

            "content": "Given the prevalence of FUBP1 upstream of the BP, we investigated its RNA-binding preferences. First, we performed electro- phoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) with a 132-nt RNA fragment upstream of the prototypical 3 0 splice site of exon 43 of the VPS13D mRNA ( VPS13D ) and a shortened fragment (36 nt) with the region showing the most FUBP1 binding in iCLIP ( VPS13D short ; Figure 2A). We observed strong binding of FUBP1(FUBP1 N-box+KH , aa 1-457) to both RNAs in the low nanomolar range (Figures 2B, 2C, and S1C). Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) with VPS13D yielded a similar result (Figure 2D; Table S2), confirming the high-affinity binding at this region.\n\nFUBP1 harbors four KH domains, which are expected to bind single-stranded RNA and DNA 32,52 and can act either independently or synergistically 53-55 to recognize extended regions of pre-mRNA. We used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to investigate the modular arrangement of the four FUBP1 KH domains. Superimposition showed that the NMR spectrum of FUBP1 KH (aa 86-457) containing KH1-4 was virtually identical to those of the individual KH domains, indicating that the KH domains are structurally independent (Figure S1D). Furthermore, NMR secondary structure analysis revealed that FUBP1 contains KH domains with a typical type I fold that are connected by flexible linkers (Figure S1E). 56 We conclude that the KH domains of FUBP1 are not preformed into an RNA-binding platform but rather can be considered like beads on a string.\n\nTo characterize the individual RNA-binding preferences of the four KH domains, we performed a scaffold-independent analysis (SIA), which is based on changes in NMR chemical shifts upon titration with short oligonucleotide motifs (Figure S2A). 57 Initial binding experiments were performed using randomized pools of 5-mer DNA, followed by verification of the identified motifs using RNA oligonucleotides (Figure S2B). SIA identified welldefined consensus motifs for KH1 (UUUG) and KH2 (UUGU) and more loosely defined motifs for KH3 (YBKK, where Y = C or U; B = C, G, or U; K = G or U) and KH4 (YUKK). Hence, all four KH domains exhibit a preference for GU-rich sequences (Figure 2E). The affinities of the individual KH domains to the final motifs, as determined by NMR spectroscopy, are in the high micromolar range (Figures S2C-S2F). Combinations of two KH domains and motifs show strong binding avidity: the ITCmeasured affinities for tandem domains were in the high nanomolar to low micromolar range (Figures S2G-S2I; Table S2). This suggests that specificity and high affinity are achieved by avidity and multivalent interactions between the four KH domains and RNA with multiple binding motifs (Figure 2F). Indeed, EMSA and ITC experiments confirmed that multiple FUBP1 binding motifs in the VPS13D mRNA fragment increase FUBP1 binding to nanomolar affinity (Figures 2A, 2C, and 2D).\n\nInterrupting the U-rich motifs of VPS13D short with cytidines severely reduces the binding affinity, underlining the specificity of the FUBP1-RNA interaction (Figure S1C).\n\nTo validate the interaction between FUBP1 and RNA motifs in cells, we compared 4-mer motifs in the sites of strongest FUBP1 binding over background in the in vivo iCLIP data. In line with the SIA, we found a strong preference for uridine-rich motifs at FUBP1 binding sites (Figures 2G and S2J). For in vivo binding, these motifs can be interspersed at any position by adenine or, to a lesser extent, by guanine. Consistent with the omnipresence of FUBP1 at 3 0 splice sites, we observed a striking enrichment of FUBP1 binding motifs (''UUU+A'' and ''UUU+G,'' i.e., three uridines interspersed at any position with adenine or guanine) upstream of the BP, where they coincide with FUBP1 binding (Figure 2H). Conversely, both ''UUU+C,'' accounting for general uridine richness, and random motif sets are enriched closer to the 3 0 splice site but not in the main region of FUBP1 binding. Importantly, enriched FUBP1 motifs upstream of the BP are a common feature across all annotated introns (Figures 2H, 2I, S2K, and S2L), indicating that we identified a previously unknown cis -regulatory RNA motif in splicing regulation."

            "content": "Given the prevalence of FUBP1 at functional 3 0 splice sites, we examined whether FUBP1 interacts with key early 3 0 splice site components in cells using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) (Figure 3A). 58 Interaction signals in the BRET assay are indicative of direct contacts or close proximities. As a proof-of-concept, we confirmed the known U2AF2-SF1 interaction. 8,10,18,58 Importantly, we also observed interactions of FUBP1withU2AF2andSF1(Figures 3B, 3C, and S2M), suggesting that FUBP1 is in close or direct contact with these core splicing factors inside cells.\n\nTo investigate whether FUBP1 directly interacts with SF1 (Figure 3C), we focused on the C-terminal region of FUBP1, which harbors the A and B boxes (A/B boxes). These motifs are specific to the FUBP family of proteins and have been shown to mediate binding to a proline-rich region of snRNP-U1-70K in fruit flies. 60,59 Similar proline-rich regions are also present in the\n\nC-terminal region of SF1. Consistently, the SF1-FUBP1 interaction detected by BRET is reduced upon deletion or mutation of the A/B boxes (Figures 3B -3DandS2M). In addition, 1 H- 15 Ncorrelation NMR spectra of the FUBP1 A/B box region show specific chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) upon titration with the proline-rich region of SF1, indicating direct binding (Figure 3E).\n\nTo map the interacting regions in FUBP1 and U2AF2, we performed NMR titration experiments using 15 N-labeled U2AF2 RRM12 14,15,30 and unlabeled full-length FUBP1. Large CSPs and line broadening in the 1 H- 15 N correlation spectra exclusively map to the U2AF2 RRM2 domain, especially to the two a helices on the backside of the b sheets that mediate RNA binding (Figures 3B, 3F, S2N, and S3A). Moreover, a construct comprising the N-terminal region of FUBP1 (FUBP1 N74 , aa 1-74) recapitulates the CSPs observed with fulllength FUBP1, whereas a construct lacking the N-terminal region (FUBP1 D N , aa 75-644) does not yield any evident CSPs (Figures 3F and S3A). Complementary NMR titrations with 15 Nlabeled FUBP1 constructs identify the U2AF2 RRM2 domain and a short peptide motif in the N-terminal region of FUBP1 (aa 27-52), referred to as N-box, as the minimal binding regions (Figures S3B -S3F). The U2AF2 RRM2-FUBP1 N-box interaction exhibits micromolar affinity by NMR titrations (Figures 3G, S3D, S3G, and S3H; Table S2).\n\nTo provide a high-resolution view, we determined the NMRderived solution structure of the U2AF2 RRM2-FUBP1 N-box complex (Figures 3H and S3I -S3K; Table 1). This structure shows a well-defined U2AF2 RRM2 domain and a more mobile helical FUBP1 N-box and reveals that the FUBP1 N-box forms an a helix, which is recognized by helices a 1 and a 2 and the b 4 strand of U2AF2 RRM2 . Hydrophobic interactions dominate at this interface, where four alanines in FUBP1 N-box (A30, A34, A38, and A42) are aligned along the extended hydrophobic interface, with A38 positioned centrally. Additional contacts involving bulkier side chains, that is, R37 and I41 in FUBP1 and L278 and M323 in U2AF2, further stabilize the binding interface. The recognition of the FUBP1 N-box resembles the interaction between FUBP1 N-box and PUF60, 34 consistent with structural similarities between PUF60 and U2AF2 RRM2 (Figure S4A). 34\n\nInterestingly, both FUBP1 N-box-RRM interfaces show only limited interdigitation of the hydrophobic side chains, consistent with the modest binding affinity in the micromolar range.\n\nIn a recent survey of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), FUBP1 was noted for its particularly high rate of non-synonymousmutations in low-grade gliomas. 1 Tolearn about the mechanistic impact of such mutations, we systematically searched cancer mutation databases and identified 26 disease-related single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) within the FUBP1 N-box (Figure S4B). Five candidate mutations (A38D, A43E, K44R, I45F, and G47C) were selected by considering the magnitude of chemical shift changes occurring in the NMR titration of FUBP1 N-box with U2AF2 RRM2 (Figures S3B -S3D and S4B). In addition, we included L35V, which has been shown to weaken the FUBP1-PUF60 interaction. 61 NMR analysis revealed that A38D strongly impairs U2AF2 binding (Figures 3I and S4CS4G). This is consistent with our structure in which A38 forms the core of the hydrophobic binding interface between FUBP1 N-box and U2AF2. A bulkier negatively charged side chain in this position is expected to introduce steric and electrostatic repulsion at the binding interface. Residue A38 in FUBP1 was also required for binding to PUF60 in a mutational study, 61 whereas L35V, which also affected the FUBP1-PUF60 interaction in that study, did not impair the interaction of FUBP1 with\n\nU2AF2 RRM2 (Figures S4C and S4D). A significant weakening of the U2AF2-FUBP1 interaction by A38D in the full-length context was also confirmed in cells using BRET (Figures 3C, 3J, and S2M). Here, some residual binding between FUBP1 A38D and U2AF2 was observed, probably because both proteins remain in proximity through binding to the same premRNAs. As expected, A38D does not affect FUBP1-SF1 binding, which occurs via the A/B boxes (Figures 3C, S4H, and S4I). In summary, our experiments demonstrate that FUBP1 interacts directly with U2AF2 and SF1 via its N-terminal N-box and C-terminal A/B boxes, respectively. The former interaction is severely impaired by a cancer-associated mutation in FUBP1."

            "content": "To investigate the impact of FUBP1 on E complex formation, we monitored U2AF2 binding to RNA using in vitro iCLIP. 28 To this end, we designed a pool of short RNA transcripts (182 nt) representing /C24 2,000 natural 3 0 splice sites from human transcripts, which we mixed with recombinant U2AF2 RRM12 (see STAR Methods). Remarkably, addition of recombinant full-length FUBP1 (FUBP1 FL ) results in stronger binding of U2AF2 RRM12 to virtually all 3 0 splice sites in the transcript pool (Figures 4A, 4B, and S5A -S5C; Table S1). The in vivo pattern of U2AF2 binding can thereby be reproduced in vitro in the presence of full-length FUBP1 (Figure 4C). The widespread effects are in contrast to those of our previous findings using in vitro -translated FUBP1, which affected only a few U2AF2 binding sites. 28 Hence, our updated experiments indicate that FUBP1 acts globally to stabilize U2AF2 binding. We find that this effect is dependent on FUBP1 concentration and is directly linked to the number of FUBP1 binding motifs upstream of the BP (Figure 4D). To confirm these findings in longer transcripts, we repeated the experiment with a pool of eight in vitro transcripts (2.0-5.7 kb; Figures S5D and S5E; Table S1). Indeed, addition of recombinant full-length FUBP1increases the strength of U2AF2 RRM12 binding at 3 0 splice sites (Figures 4E and S5F) and thereby reproduces the in vivo binding pattern of U2AF2 (Figure 4F). Notably, this effect is considerably reduced with FUBP1 D N (impaired U2AF2 interaction), and it is completely abolished with FUBP1 N74 (lacking KH domains). This highlights the importance of the N-box in FUBP1 for directly interacting with U2AF2 as well as of FUBP1's RNA binding for the stabilization of U2AF2 (Figures 4F and S5F). Together, this indicates that the interaction of FUBP1 with both pre-mRNA and U2AF2 globally promotes U2AF2 binding at the 3 0 splice site during early spliceosomal assembly."

            "subtitle": "## FUBP1 is critical for the splicing of long introns",
            "content": "To investigate the impact of FUBP1 on splicing, we generated a FUBP1 knockout (KO) RPE1 cell line using CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering (Figures 5A and S5G) and performed RNA-seq. MYC gene expression was unaltered, suggesting that it is not controlled by FUBP1 in RPE1 cells (Figure S5H). Next, we examined transcriptome-wide splicing and found 1,041 significant splicing changes, including 399 cassette exons (Figure 5B; Tables S1 and S3). Consistent with a role in splice site recognition, FUBP1 KOpreferentially leads to exon skipping (276 [69%] with delta percent spliced in [ D PSI] &lt; /C0 0.1).\n\nA closer inspection revealed that the fate of an exon is related to the length of the flanking introns: decreased inclusion in FUBP1 KO cells is typically observed for exons that are flanked by longer introns, compared with exons with increased or unchanged inclusion (Figure 5B, top). Most affected exons are alternative exons, but we observed the same effect for regulated constitutive exons (Figure S5I). Importantly, the effect on long introns can be recapitulated in ENCODE 62,63 data on FUBP1 knockdown cells (Figure 5B, bottom). To test whether this depends on the interaction with U2AF2, we generated a FUBP1Nbox mut mutant with a targeted deletion of A38 and neighboring amino acids in the endogenous FUBP1 gene in RPE1 cells (Figures 5A and S5G). Although overall fewer cassette exons are regulated in this mutant (n = 81), exons are predominantly skipped (n = 45), and these are flanked by longer introns (Figure S5J). Together, these data reveal that FUBP1 is important for the splicing of long introns and suggest a functional role for the N-box in this process.\n\nTo investigate whether FUBP1 mutations in tumor cells affect splicing, we analyzed data from glioma patients. 1 Intriguingly, we found that skipped exons in patients with FUBP1 loss-of-function mutations have longer adjacent introns than exons dysregulated in patients harboring other splicing factor mutations (Figures 5C and S6A). The effect is also evident upon FUBP1 knockdown in the glioblastoma cell line U87MG from the same study (Figure 5C). Together, these data strongly suggest that FUBP1 plays a role in the efficient splicing of long introns, thereby affecting the inclusion of adjacent exons.\n\nTo validate the role of FUBP1 for long introns, we constructed a minigene for the alternative exon 18 in the MPDZ transcript, which is skipped upon FUBP1 KO in RPE1 cells. The minigene comprises the alternative exon with the flanking constitutive exons and intervening long introns (&gt;2.4 kb). In vivo iCLIP data show that FUBP1 binds at both 3 0 splice sites, which was confirmed in vitro by EMSA with FUBP1 N-box+KH (aa 1-457; Figures S6B and S6C). We observed a marked decrease of alternative exon inclusion from the MPDZ minigene in FUBP1 KO (16% inclusion) and an intermediate effect (25%) in FUBP1Nbox mut cells, compared with wild-type (WT) cells (31% inclusion; Figures 5D, S6B, and S6D). Upon mutation of the FUBP1\n\nbinding sites, the exon showed reduced inclusion (7%) and did not change in the FUBP1 KO. If the introns were shortened but the FUBP1 binding sites retained, the effect of FUBP1 KOormutation was reduced, albeit still present, consistent with the notion that the intron is still perceived as long due to the presence of FUBP1 binding site. By contrast, if the FUBP1 binding sites were also removed, exon inclusion no longer responded to FUBP1 KO or FUBP1-Nbox mut , highlighting that FUBP1 binding is specifically required for the long-intron variant.\n\nIntriguingly, the changes at long introns are linked to FUBP1 binding. We found a substantial increase in FUBP1 binding at the 3 0 splice sites of longer introns, both in absolute terms and relative to other splicing factors (Figures 5E and 5F). Differential FUBP1 binding was not observed for other exon-intron-related features, such as splice site, Py tract, and BP strength (Figures S6E -S6H). Furthermore, longer introns exhibit a marked enrichment of FUBP1 motifs upstream of the BP (Figures 5G and 5H). By contrast, random motif occurrences or splice site strength are independent of intron length (Figures S6I and S6J). Moreover, long introns were previously observed to preferentially locate to the nuclear periphery and exhibit a differential GC content architecture. 64,65 Indeed, we found that the occurrence of FUBP1 binding motifs correlates with the GC content architecture (Figures S6K -S6M). Furthermore, FUBP1 binds stronger to introns located in the nuclear periphery (Figure S6N) and to splice sites of exons with differential GC content architecture (Figures S7A -S7C). Further analysis indicated that both intron length and differential GC content architecture affect FUBP1 binding (Figure S7D).\n\nAlthough splicing is an ancient molecular mechanism, gene architecture and especially intron length are subject to substantial evolutionary change (Figure S7E). We hypothesized that FUBP1 is present throughout Eukaryota and that lineage-specific losses or modifications of FUBP1 are accompanied by changes in average intron length. Indeed, we find overall that FUBP1 is well conserved. Although losses do occur, they are mostly observed in taxa with short introns such as protozoa and fungi (Figures 5I and 5J). Species with FUBP1 consistently harbor more FUBP1 motifs at their 3 0 splice sites (Figure 5K). By contrast, U-rich motifs interspersed with C, which do not accumulate in the region of\n\nFUBP1 binding (Figure 5G), are least enriched in species with FUBP1. Comparing FUBP1's domain architecture across eukaryotic evolution, we find that C-terminal A/B boxes are an animalspecific innovation. Their appearance in evolution is associated with an overall increase in intron length in animals compared with other eukaryotes (Figure 5I). Together, this suggests that FUBP1binding to its RNA motifs and its protein-protein interfaces play important roles in the splicing of long introns."

            "subtitle": "## FUBP1 interacts with both splice sites suggesting a function in cross-intron bridging",
            "content": "To decipher the molecular mechanism of FUBP1 action, we developed a kinetic model of cassette exon splicing using ordinary differential equations (Figures 6A and S7F; Table S4). In line with our previous work, 66 we considered a scenario for ''exon definition'' in which the U1 and U2 snRNPs recognize the 5 0 and 3 0 regions flanking an exon as functional units. The subsequent splice site pairing by U1/U2 snRNP interaction across the intron, that is, intron definition, triggers splicing catalysis, which results in either cassette exon inclusion, skipping, or intron retention in the model. We first simulated the loss of FUBP1 in a model in which FUBP1 solely acts on initial U1/U2 snRNP binding to exons (exon definition). However, our simulations argue against a pure exon definition effect, as the model cannot recapitulate the splicing changes that occur upon FUBP1 KO (Figure 6B; model 1). According to our experimental data, exons flanked by two long introns are typically skipped upon FUBP1 KO, whereas exons flanked by at least one short intron tend to show slightly increased inclusion. Surprisingly, the experimental data are more consistent with an alternative model in which FUBP1 enhances the pairing of splice sites across long (but not short) introns during intron definition. The model predicts reduced exon inclusion upon FUBP1 KO specifically for exons flanked by two long introns, whereas exons flanked by one short intron moderately increase, irrespective of whether it is located upstream or downstream (Figure 6B; model 2). These results also hold true in a modified model, in which\n\n## Figure 6. FUBP1 interacts with U1 snRNP components\n\nexons are not defined as functional units, and intron splicing solely requires U1 and U2 binding to flanking splice sites (Figure S7G, ''intron definition model''). Taken together, the experimental observations are consistent with the kinetic model, which assumes that FUBP1 differentially affects long introns by promoting splice site pairing and the formation of catalytically active spliceosomes across long introns.\n\nTo test this prediction, we investigated the cross-linking of FUBP1 to snRNAs, indicative of its presence at different stages of splicing. First, FUBP1 showed substantial cross-linking to U2 snRNA, consistent with FUBP1 binding upstream of the BP where the U2 snRNP replaces SF1, indicating that FUBP1 is present during A-complex formation (Figure 6C). More importantly, FUBP1 alsocross-linkstoU1snRNA,whichbindstothe5 0 splicesite, suggesting that FUBP1 is present during the bridging of the 3 0 and 5 0 splice sites, either during initial exon definition or also at later stages of intron definition. The latter is further supported by the cross-linking of FUBP1 to U6 snRNA, which replaces U1 snRNA at the 5 0 splice site prior to lariat formation (Figure 6C). Hence, FUBP1mightbeinvolvedinintronbridgingthroughoutthesplicing cycle. We next searched our iCLIP datasets for evidence that FUBP1isstill bound in the spliceosomal C complex when the lariat has formed after the first splicing reaction. It has been shown that readsfromthelariattruncateatthepositionwherethe5 0 splice site is covalently linked to the BP and is detected as a single-nucleotide-wide peak at the 5 0 splice site (Figure 6D). 68,69 Indeed, we observed a strong peak in read truncations for FUBP1 at the 5 0 splice site, whereas there was almost no signal for the other splicing factors tested (Figure 6E). This suggests that FUBP1 is present from the early stages of spliceosome assembly until at least the first catalytic step of the splicing reaction.\n\nTo further investigate whether FUBP1 is actively involved in splice-site bridging, we searched available binary protein-protein interaction data from yeast two-hybrid screens. 67 These data confirmed that FUBP1 binds to U2AF2 (Figure 6F). We also found evidence for FUBP1 interacting with several U1-associated proteins (SNRPA, SNRPC, TIAL1, and PRPF40B) as well\n\nas with SNRPB, which is a member of the Sm protein ring in all snRNPs (Figure 6F). These and further interactions of FUBP1 with U1-associated proteins (TCERG1 and KHDRBS1) were confirmed using the BRET assay and/or NMR (Figures 6F, 6G, and S7H). Interestingly, several of the U1 snRNP-associated proteins harbor proline-rich regions, which potentially interact with the A/B boxes in FUBP1, similar to the FUBP1-SF1 interaction discussed above. Indeed, we observed significant changes in the NMR spectrum of FUBP1 A/B upon the addition of a prolinerich peptide from SNRPB (Figure 6H), which were less pronounced with SNRPA and PRPF40B derivates (Figures S7I and S7J). This correlates well with the proline-rich region in SNRPB being much larger than in SNRPA or PRPF40B and thus avidity effects perhaps enhance the binding.\n\nFinally, to confirm the importance of the FUBP1 A/B boxes and their role in splice-site bridging, we performed a complementation assay by expressing full-length GFP-FUBP1 and different mutants in both WT and FUBP1 KO RPE1 cells. Effects on splicing were monitored using the co-transfected MPDZ minigene. As expected, GFP-FUBP1 complements the FUBP1 KO cells and rescues MPDZ exon inclusion close to WT levels (Figures 6I, S7K, and S7L). Importantly, expression of GFPFUBP1 W586,615R (mutations in the A/B boxes) or FUBP1 D C (complete deletion of the C terminus) impairs complementation in FUBP1 KO cells. The same was also observed if the interaction with U2AF2 is perturbed by expressing either FUBP1 A38D (N-box mutation) or FUBP1 D N (complete deletion of the N terminus). Overall, these data demonstrate that both the A/B boxes and the N-box in FUBP1, which mediate the interactions with factors at the 5 0 and 3 0 splice sites, respectively, are functionally relevant for splicing."
