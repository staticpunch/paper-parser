Although individual metastasis-associated genes have been described, the complex regulatory networks presiding over the initiation and maintenance of metastatic tumors are still poorly understood. There is untapped value in identifying therapeutic targets that broadly govern coordinated transcriptional modules dictating metastatic progression. Here, we reverse engineered and interrogated a breast cancer-specific transcriptional interaction network (interactome) to define transcriptional control structures causally responsible for regulating genetic programs underlying breast cancer metastasis in individual patients. Our analyses confirmed established pro-metastatic transcription factors, and they uncovered TRIM25 as a key regulator of metastasis-related transcriptional programs. Further, in vivo analyses established TRIM25 as a potent regulator of metastatic disease and poor survival outcome. Our findings suggest that identifying and targeting keystone proteins, like TRIM25, can effectively collapse transcriptional hierarchies necessary for metastasis formation, thus representing an innovative cancer intervention strategy.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nMetastatic progression is the primary underlying cause of breast cancer-associated death (Spano et al., 2012). Although both functional and genomic studies have identified important genetic aberrations associated with risk of malignant progression (Navin, 2015), the fundamental drivers and the associated complex mechanisms of breast cancer metastasis remain poorly mapped and poorly understood. Specifically, several pathways have been identified as contributors to metastatic disease (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011), but identification and dissection of the regulatory machinery that is necessary and sufficient to implement metastatic progression (metastasis checkpoints) remain critically unanswered questions in cancer research.\n\nTo systematically and quantitatively address this, we approached metastatic progression as a transition between two cellular states defined by the differential gene expression signature of these states in the same patient, using patient-matched primary and metastatic samples. Then we investigated the specific transcriptional regulators responsible for initiating this transition, and ultimately for maintaining the stability of the metastatic state, based on their mechanistic ability to regulate differentially expressed genes (i.e., the transition signature). We have shown that the specific transcriptional regulators that determine such cancer-related state transitions can be efficiently and systematically elucidated by interrogating tumor-specific transcriptional networks (henceforth interactomes) with representative differential gene expression signatures, using the virtual inference of protein activity by regulon enrichment analysis (VIPER) algorithm (Alvarez et al., 2016), which further extends the master regulator inference algorithm\n\n(MARINa) (Lefebvre et al., 2010) to the analysis of single samples. These validated analyses have helped elucidate master regulator (MR) proteins whose concerted, aberrant activity is both necessary and sufficient for tumor phenotype implementation and maintenance, including tumor initiation (Aytes et al., 2014; Carro et al., 2010), progression (Aytes et al., 2014; Lefebvre et al., 2010), and drug resistance (Piovan et al., 2013; Rodriguez-Barrueco et al., 2015).\n\nTo implement this approach, we first assembled a breast cancer-specific regulatory network, using the algorithm for the reconstruction of accurate cellular networks (ARACNe) (Basso et al., 2005; Margolin et al., 2006b). Then we identified differential gene expression signatures representing same-patient cell state transitions from primary tumors to lymph node metastases, using both ER-positive (ER+) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) samples. Finally, we used the VIPER algorithm to prioritize transcriptional regulators that are the most likely causal determinants of these metastasis-related signatures. Using this strategy, we uncovered a hierarchy of transcriptional regulators controlling metastatic progression, revealing both previously unknown and well-established pro-metastatic transcription factors, thus confirming the potential value of the proposed methodology.\n",

            "content": "To identify the transcriptional machinery driving breast cancer metastasis (Figure 1A), we first characterized the transcriptional signature representative of breast carcinoma metastatic progression (metastasis [MET] gene expression signature [METGES]). This was achieved by differential expression analysis of patient-matched primary tumors and lymph node metastases from 20 ER+ and 11 TNBC patients (Figure S1A; Table S1). Critically, two-tail gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA2) of these signatures revealed strong concordance across the two subtypes, suggesting the existence of common metastatic progression mechanisms (Figures S1B-S1D), independent of hormonal state.\n\nTo identify the genes that causally implement the MET-GES, thus representing candidate causal determinants of breast carcinoma metastatic progression, we utilized the VIPER algorithm (Aytes et al., 2014; Carro et al., 2010). To assemble a breast carcinoma-specific interactome, we analyzed 851 The Cancer\n\nGenome Atlas (TCGA) breast carcinoma gene expression profiles using the ARACNe algorithm (Basso et al., 2005; Margolin et al., 2006a). ARACNe is an information theory-based approach to infer mechanistic interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and target genes based on large sets of gene expression data, which has proven very effective in assembling interactomes for VIPER analysis (Alvarez et al., 2016; Basso et al., 2010; Carro et al., 2010; Kushwaha et al., 2015; Lefebvre et al., 2010). The ARACNe-inferred breast cancer interactome included 1,748 TFs, regulating 18,783 target genes through 365,634 transcriptional interactions. A schematic representation of our pipeline is represented in Figure 1A.\n\nFinally, we inferred the regulatory proteins that are candidate drivers of the MET-GES by VIPER analysis of the breast carcinoma interactome. The algorithm prioritizes the regulatory proteins that are the most likely determinants of an observed differential expression signature, and thus of the associated cell state transition, by assessing the enrichment of their direct targets (regulons) in differentially expressed signature genes (i.e., in genes that are over- or underexpressed during metastatic progression, in this case). Thus, the ARACNe-inferred regulon of each regulatory protein (Table S2) is used as a highly multiplexed, endogenous reporter for its role in physically controlling metastatic progression. We used the statistical significance, estimated by sample permutation analysis, to rank-sort the list of putative MRs of the metastatic phenotype in ER+ breast cancer and TNBC (Table S3). Given the strong concordance between ER+ and TNBC MET-GES and between candidate MRs of the two subtypes (Figures S1B-S1D), we inferred the MRs of metastatic progression of breast carcinoma regardless of subtype by VIPER analysis of a subtype-agnostic MET-GES. This generated a single ranked list of breast cancer metastatic progression candidate MRs (breast cancer [BRCA]), independent of hormonal status (Figure 1B; Table S3). From these analyses, TRIM25 emerged by far as the strongest candidate MR (p = 3.25 3 10 /C0 5 ). A schematic summary of these data is shown in Figure S1E.\n\nOf the top candidate MRs, most are largely unexplored metastasis-associated genes, ranking significantly higher than wellknown pro-metastatic TFs, such as c-MYC (ranked 585), ETV4 (ranked 1,443), and SMAD4 (ranked 1,447). Nevertheless, the high ranking of breast cancer-specific metastasis-associated TFs, such as PRRX-1 (ranked 6, p = 6.8 3 10 /C0 4 ) further corroborates the accuracy of our approach. Importantly, top candidate MR genes were not highly differentially expressed following\n\nmetastatic progression. In fact, none of the top 15 candidate MR genes were in the top 100 most differentially expressed genes, and, therefore, they could not have been identified without direct analysis of their regulatory context. This further emphasizes the distinct advantage of the proposed methodology. As previously shown (Chen et al., 2014), regulatory proteins with the highest probability to directly regulate the signature of interest are more likely to be critically necessary to implement the associated cell state transition, because they represent the most proximal integrators (i.e., regulatory bottlenecks) of genetic and epigenetic determinants of the associated phenotype. This suggests that TRIM25 may be a more universal determinant of metastatic progression in breast cancer as compared to previously identified genes that appear further down in the prioritized MR list.\n\nWe based the analysis on an average gene expression signature of metastatic progression across all ER+ and TNBC METs. Thus, while it is effective in identifying mechanisms that are common across most of the patients, it fails to capture mechanisms that may be patient specific. We thus extended our analysis at the single-patient level by inferring the transcriptional regulators driving each patient's metastatic progression with the VIPER algorithm (Alvarez et al., 2016). This analysis also identified TRIM25asthemostconsistently activated regulator in these metastases (Figure 1C), further supporting its role as a key regulator of the metastatic progression in both ER+ and TNBC tumors."

            "content": "To functionally test these hypotheses, we performed small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown for a selected set of 14 MRs in 2 ER+ (MCF7 and T-47D) and 2 TNBC (BT549 and MDAMB-231) cell lines, and we analyzed subsequent changes in gene expression using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) (Table S4). The MR genes selected for validation represent the top most differentially activated TFs in each of the patient-derived signatures, including the breast carcinoma BRCA MET-GES, the ER+ MET-GES, and the TNBC MET-GES (Figures 1B, 1C, and S2A; Table S3). MRs were prioritized by stepwise linear regression with exhaustive selection to first identify the best combination of MRs controlling the metastatic progression signature and then to compute the fraction of metastasis signature genes regulated by each MR, using GSEA leading-edge analysis (Subramanian et al., 2005). The best linear combination of n MRs, where n was the highest number of MRs for which all coefficients of the model were different than zero at Bonferroni's corrected p &lt; 0.001, was selected by maximizing the variance explained by the model (Figures S2B and S2C; Table S5). Employing a complementary approach, we repeated this analysis by separately comparing the expression between metastasis and primary tumor for each individual patient. Stepwise linear regression with exhaustive search was applied to each gene expression signature and then integrated by the Stouffer method. Results were very similar using either method (Table S5).\n\nTheidentification of established metastasis-associated genes, such as PRRX-1 , FOXQ1 , and PAX5 (O'Brien et al., 2011; Ocan \u02dc a et al., 2012; Ratkaj et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2011), demonstrates the robustness of our methodology toward elucidating meta- static progression drivers. Based on these analyses, TRIM25 emerged as the strongest (i.e., most statistically significant) MR candidate using both TNBC cell lines and patient breast tumor-derived signatures (Figures S2B and S2C). TRIM25 also significantly regulated the ER+ MET-GES in 1 ER+ cell line (Table S5). Critically, siRNA-mediated silencing of TRIM25 strongly affected 50% of the top 20 VIPER-inferred candidate MRs (Table S4), demonstrating that TRIM25 can coordinate multiple downstream transcriptional programs to implement the metastatic progression transcriptional signature. The predicted regulatory relationship between TRIM25 and target transcripts is shown in Figure 1D."

            "subtitle": "## TRIM25 Expression Is Not Correlated with Estrogen Signaling",
            "content": "TRIM25 wasoriginally named estrogen-responsive finger protein (EFP), and it has since been described as an estrogen-responsive gene and a co-factor for estrogen signaling. Therefore, the identification of TRIM25 as the most statistically significant candidate metastatic progression MR in TNBC was surprising. Yet, when we compared TRIM25 expression in ER+ and TNBC tumors from TCGA, it was actually significantly higher in the latter (Figure S2D). Consistent with these findings, we did not observe estrogen-dependent expression of TRIM25 in multiple high-throughput studies that test the effects of estrogen on gene expression (Carroll et al., 2006; Creighton et al., 2006; Kamalakaran et al., 2005; Lin et al., 2004).\n\nTo further investigate the relationship between TRIM25 and estrogen signaling, we generated a Spearman's correlation matrix using RNA-seq expression data from 1,100 breast cancer tumors, comparing TRIM25 expression with ten established estrogen-responsive genes (Figure S2E). As expected, Estrogen receptor 1 ( ESR1 ) expression correlated strongly with all ten estrogen-responsive genes. Yet, despite being expressed in ER+ tumors, expression of TRIM25 was not correlated with the expression of ESR1 or other estrogen-responsive genes. For comparison, we also included the Y box-binding protein 1 ( YBX1 ) in these analyses, a gene specifically associated with estrogen-negative tumors. While the analysis revealed significant negative correlation between YBX1 expression and the expression of estrogen-responsive genes, as well as ESR1 , no correlation was detected with TRIM25 expression. Taken together, these results suggest that TRIM25 expression can be regulated by factors independent of estrogen or estrogen signaling, especially in TNBCs."

            "content": "To test the effect of TRIM25 on the metastatic potential of TNBC cells, we engineered human MDA-MB-231 cells, derived from a TNBC tumor, to express either high (TRIM25 high ) or low (TRIM25 low ) levels of TRIM25 (Figure S3A), and we labeled them with Luc-GFP or Luc-RFP. Distinctly labeled TRIM25 high and TRIM25 low cells were mixed 1:1, injected into the lateral tail vein of athymic nude mice, and monitored for the development of lung metastases via bioluminescence imaging. When lung metastases were visible, mice were sacrificed and their lungs were first imaged via ex vivo fluorescence imaging and\n\nspectral unmixing for a global picture of the relative abundance of TRIM25 high versus TRIM25 low cells (Figure 2A). Lungs were then sectioned and the percentage content of TRIM25 high versus TRIM25 low cells was accurately quantified via immunofluorescence (Figures 2B and 2C). We found that TRIM25 high cells constituted the overwhelming majority of metastatic burden in the lungs compared to TRIM25 low cells (Figures 2A-2C). We confirmed these results in parallel experiments, in which TRIM25 high and TRIM25 low fluorophores were switched.\n\nIntriguingly, increased expression of TRIM25 did not affect proliferation or invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro (Figures S3B and S3C). We then used a primary culture generated from a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of TNBC to test the effect of TRIM25 perturbation on primary tumor growth in vivo. Consistent with the in vitro assays, we found that neither TRIM25 knockdown nor overexpression altered primary tumor growth in the mammary fat pad of NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice (Figures S3D-S3F). Similarly, when we injected the aforementioned fluorescently labeled TRIM25 high :TRIM25 low cell mixture into the mammary fat pad of NSG mice, we found that TRIM25 did not affect cellular proliferation at the orthotopic site, with TRIM25 high and TRIM25 low cells showing uniform representation in primary tumors &gt;1 cm in diameter (Figure 2D). Notably, when these mice became symptomatic and lungs were harvested, we found that TRIM25 high cells metastasized to the lung more efficiently than TRIM25 low cells, despite representing a similar fraction in corresponding primary tumors (Figures 2E and 2F). Interestingly, perturbation of TRIM25 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells injected into the mammary fat pad of NSG mice in limiting dilution experiments revealed that TRIM25 knockdown resulted in decreased seeding potential, suggesting TRIM25 may be involved in promoting self-renewal (a stem-like phenotype) (Figure S3G). We further explored the relationship between TRIM25 and metastasis in an additional TNBC cell line, CAL-51. TRIM25 knockdown in CAL-51 cells injected into the lateral tail vein of athymic nude mice resulted in significantly decreased lung metastases (Figures 2G and S3H). Lungs were stained with anti-human COX4 to clearly differentiate human CAL-51 metastases from mouse lung tissue (Figure 2G). Overexpression of TRIM25 in CAL-51 cells resulted in an /C24 2-fold increase in lung metastases (p = 0.10; Figures 2H and S3H). This increase was not due to an increase in extravasa-\n\n## Figure 2.

            "content": "To determine whether the E3 ubiquitin ligase domain of TRIM25 was required for TRIM25 to promote metastasis, first we employed a CRISPR strategy to knock out TRIM25 (TKO) in 2 TNBC cell lines (Figures 3A and S4A). Then, we expressed either full-length TRIM25 (TRIM25) or a RING-deficient TRIM25 (TRIM25 D R) in these cells (Figures 3B and 3C). The lack of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity was confirmed in TRIM25 D R cells (Figure S4B). Tail vein-injected CAL-51-TKO cells expressing either TRIM25 or TRIM25 D R rescued the metastasis phenotype to a similar extent, suggesting that the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of TRIM25 is not required (at least entirely) for promoting metastasis in this context (Figure 3D). In contrast, orthotopic injection of BT549-TKO cells expressing TRIM25 D R only partially rescued the seeding potential of TNBCs that expressed fulllength TRIM25 (Figure 3E), suggesting that the E3 ubiquitin ligase domain of TRIM25 may, in part, contribute to tumorigenicity and, therefore, metastatic potential. Interestingly, the expression of TRIM25 or TRIM25 D R did not alter the localization of TRIM25 in TNBCs via immunofluorescence (Figure S4C). Consistent with the role of TRIM25 in promoting metastasis, expression of TRIM25 or TRIM25 D R(Figure S4D) in an already highly metastatic TNBC line did not significantly affect primary tumor growth or spontaneous lung metastasis (Figures 3F and 3G). Further, injection of these cells into the lateral tail vein of nude mice revealed no differences in metastatic seeding in the lung (Figure 3H). Together these data suggest TRIM25 promotes metastasis through multiple mechanisms, with at least one being independent of its E3 ligase activity."

            "content": "Since TRIM25 contains a hallmark zinc-finger B-box DNAbinding domain (Figure S5A), we hypothesized that it regulates the BRCA metastatic signature, at least in part, as a bona fide TF. Cell fractionation of ER+ breast cancer and TNBC cells revealed that TRIM25 is present in the cytoplasmic, nuclear, and chromatin fractions (Figures 4A and S5B). Immunofluorescence\n\nrevealed TRIM25 was most abundantly localized to the perinuclear region (Figure 4B). To investigate the DNA-binding properties of TRIM25, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) in the TNBC cell lines BT549 and MDA-MB-231. TRIM25 ChIP antibody was validated according to Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) guidelines (Landt et al., 2012), and a representative immunoprecipitation (IP) is shown in Figure S5C. The distribution of ChIP-seq peaks (genome ontology) is shown in Figures 4C and 4D. Interestingly, TRIM25 primarily associated with DNA at CpG islands and gene promoters. Several ChIP targets were selected for validation by qPCR (Figure S5D). When we examined the metastasis signature genes by plotting TRIM25 ChIP-seq reads (input) for the top 876 genes (p &lt; 0.05) from the TNBC MET-GES, we observed that TRIM25 mainly localizes to the transcriptional start site (TSS) of these genes (Figures 4E-4H).\n\nTo further refine the identity of genes transcriptionally regulated by TRIM25, we performed iterative GSEA (iGSEA) while incrementally increasing the number of top TRIM25-bound genes, based on TSS peak scores, compared to the cell line data in which TRIM25 was silenced (GES) as negative control. The TRIM25-bound gene set was determined as the smallest set for which a maximum GSEA enrichment score could be obtained (Figure 4I). These TRIM25-bound genes were significantly enriched in genes that were upregulated following siRNA-mediated silencing of TRIM25 (siTRIM25-GES), both in BT549 and in MDA-MB-231 cells. This was consistent with TRIM25 functioning, at least in part, as a transcriptional repressor (Figures 4J and 4K). Specific overlap is shown in Figures S5E and S5F and Table S4. Further, iGSEA inferred TRIM25-bound genes were significantly enriched among the downregulated MET-GES genes for both BT549 and MDAMB-231 cells, again suggesting that TRIM25 may function as a transcriptional repressor to regulate the MET-GES (Figures 4L and 4M). Specific overlap is represented in Figures S5G and S5H and Table S4."

We randomly chose 3 positive and 3 negative RIP-seq target genes to confirm by qRT-PCR (Figure S6A).

The specific overlap is represented in Figures S6B and S6C.

            "content": "Next, we proceeded to examine the relationship between transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, as mediated by TRIM25. First, to identify the core set of genes transcriptionally regulated by TRIM25 in TNBC, we integrated the TRIM25 ChIP-seq results with gene expression changes resulting from TRIM25 knockdown in cell lines. While the former indicates binding of TRIM25 to promoter regions, the latter provides clues about causal regulatory effects on transcription. Confirming our analysis and the ARACNe-inferred regulon of TRIM25, these core genes were significantly enriched in genes downregulated in the MET-GES (Figure S6F). In parallel, we identified a core set of genes post-transcriptionally regulated by TRIM25 in TNBC by integrating the TRIM25 RIP-seq results with gene expression profiles following siRNAmediated silencing of TRIM25 in TNBC cell lines. This second core gene set, which is post-transcriptionally regulated by TRIM25, was also significantly enriched in genes downregulated in the MET-GES (Figure S6G). Remarkably, we also found significant overlap between the transcriptional and post-transcriptional TRIM25-regulated core gene sets (Figure 5F), suggesting that TRIM25 regulates the expression of these genes at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, thus implementing a classic feedforward loop structure.\n\nTogain insight into the potentially distinct biological processes mediated by TRIM25 transcriptionally versus post-transcriptionally, we performed pathway enrichment analysis, using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Biocarta, and Reactome pathways from the Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB) (Subramanian et al., 2005), on these core gene sets.\n\nWe found a striking overlap between processes regulated by TRIM25 transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally (Figure 5G; Table S6), suggesting that TRIM25 may control these biological processes through tight transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms."

            "content": "To assess which cellular processes associated with metastasis are modulated by TRIM25, we first inferred the highest confidence MET-GES genes transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally regulated by TRIM25 as the genes in the leading edge when computing the enrichment of the core set of genes transcriptionally or post-transcriptionally regulated by TRIM25 on the MET-GES (Figure S7A). Next, we performed gene ontology (GO) analysis on these gene sets. Enriched biological processes were dominated by developmental processes (Figure 6A), suggesting that TRIM25 may mediate metastases by affecting differentiation.\n\nNext we tested whether altering more than one MR, which together more broadly cover the MET-GES, is sufficient to enhance tumor implantation in an otherwise poorly tumorigenic breast cancer cell line, BT549. We found that modulation of TRIM25 and zinc-finger protein 581 ( ZNF581) in combination yielded the most substantial coverage of the MET-GES (61%) compared to all other pairs of candidates (Figures S2B and S2C; Table S5). We therefore overexpressed TRIM25 and knocked down ZNF581 in BT549 cells (Figure S7B), and we performed a limiting dilution assay in the mammary fat pads of NSG mice. Concomitant TRIM25 overexpression and ZNF581 knockdown significantly enhanced tumorigenicity (Figure 6B) without affecting proliferation in vitro (Figure S7C), indicative of an expanded tumor-initiating cell population with this combined genetic alteration. These data suggest that broad coverage of our MET-GES could perpetuate the metastasis phenotype.\n\nTo gain further insight into the specific effect of TRIM25 on the phenotype of TNBC cells, we characterized the global transcriptional changes downstream of TRIM25. GSEA was performed on genes identified by RNA-seq to be differentially expressed upon knockdown of TRIM25 in BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Of the 189 MSigDB oncogenic gene signatures tested, we found that the strongest enrichment was a signature related to differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), suggesting that TRIM25 may be involved in the maintenance of stemness (Figure 6C; Table S7). This is particularly interesting as TRIM25 was previ- ously found to be the target of 7 of 9 pluripotency factors in ESCs (Figure 6D) (Kim et al., 2008), and TRIM25 expression is significantly decreased during embryonic differentiation (Kwon et al., 2013).\n\nWe functionally tested this correlative relationship using human ESCs (hESCs). To determine whether loss of TRIM25 could induce differentiation, we lentivirally expressed short hairpins against TRIM25 . Strikingly, TRIM25 depletion induced changes in hESC morphology consistent with differentiation (Figure 6E). qRT-PCR of RNA isolated 4 days post-transfection revealed a considerable increase in mesoderm, endoderm, and ectoderm marker genes after TRIM25 knockdown, suggesting that TRIM25 is required to maintain a stem cell state (Figure 6F). Recently, Akrap and colleagues used single-cell RNA-seq to identify markers of functionally enriched stem and progenitor cells in breast cancer. In both primary breast tumors and TNBC cell lines, POU5F1 , NANOG , and SOX2 were major determinants of a quiescent cancer stem cell (CSC)-like cell phenotype with high stemness and tumorgenicity (Akrap et al., 2016). Using our CRISPR TRIM25-knockout cell models, we found that expression of either TRIM25 or TRIM25 D R in TNBC-TKO cells increased the expression of POU5F1 , NANOG , and SOX2 (Figures 6G and 6H), suggesting that TRIM25 regulates the core genes involved in maintaining quiescent CSC-like phenotypes. Together, these results suggest TRIM25 promotes metastasis through increasing the stemness and tumorigenicity of breast cancer cells, enhancing their capacity for colonization, survival, and outgrowth at the secondary site.\n\nAcross32cancertypesfromTCGA, TRIM25 wasrarelydeleted and was most frequently amplified in breast cancer (Figures 7A and 7B). TRIM25 amplification was associated with a significant increase in mRNA expression (Figure 7C). Kaplan-Meier log rank test using RNA-seq data consisting of 1,038 breast cancer tumors from TCGA revealed that elevated TRIM25 expression is significantly associated with poor overall survival (Figure 7D). Further, prediction of clinical outcomes from genomic profiles (PRECOG) analysis of TRIM25 confirmed that TRIM25 expression is significantly associated with poor outcome in breast cancer (Figure 7E). In fact, TRIM25 was most strongly associated with poor outcome in breast cancer over any other cancer type. There were no significant differences based on TRIM25 expression or predicted protein activity in normal breast tissue comparedtoprimarytumors(Figures 7F and 7G). However, there was a significant difference in the activity of TRIM25 protein between primary tumors and metastases (Figure 7H). In addition,\n\nalthough the TCGA dataset only contains 7 matched pairs of primary tumors and metastases, 6 of 7 metastases had higher TRIM25 expression than their respective primary tumors (Figure 7I). TRIM25 immunohistochemistry in primary breast tumors, lymph node, and distant metastases revealed similar TRIM25 localization, suggesting localization of TRIM25 is not overtly altered during metastatic progression (Figure 7J). Together, these data support a role of TRIM25 as a driver of poor outcome in breast cancer."
