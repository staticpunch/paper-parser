However, overexpression of IGF 1 R has not been properly assessed in HCC. Here, we revealed that GSTZ 1 -1 , the enzyme in phenylalanine/tyrosine catabolism, is downregulated in HCC, and its expression was negatively correlated with IGF 1 R. Mechanistically, GSTZ 1 -1 deficiency led to succinylacetone accumulation, alkylation modification of KEAP 1 , and NRF 2 activation, thus promoting IGF 1 R transcription by recruiting SP 1 to its promoter. Moreover, inhibition of IGF 1 R or NRF 2 significantly inhibited tumor-promoting effects of GSTZ 1 knockout in vivo . These findings establish succinylacetone as an oncometabolite, and GSTZ 1 -1 as an important tumor suppressor by inhibiting NRF 2 /IGF 1 R axis in HCC. Targeting NRF 2 or IGF 1 R may be a promising treatment approach for this subset HCC.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling axis is critical in the growth and development of various tissues. Upon binding to the IGF ligand, IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R) is activated through autophosphorylation. The two main downstream signals of IGF1R are the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT and Ras/Raf/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways, playing a prominent role in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Yu &amp; Rohan, 2000). Increasing evidence shows that IGF1R and its ligands (IGF-1, IGF-2) play an important role in the development and progression of several cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Aleem et al , 2011; Pollak, 2012). Although overexpression and activation of IGF1R have not been properly assessed in HCC, several approaches targeting IGF1R have been developed in an effort to engineer therapeutic strategies for HCC (Lodhia et al , 2015).\n\nMetabolic reprogramming to support the bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands of rapid cell proliferation is a hallmark of cancer (Hanahan &amp; Weinberg, 2011). Cancer cells exhibit enhanced glucose uptake coupled to lactate extrusion even in oxygen-rich conditions, which is well known as the Warburg effect (Ward &amp; Thompson, 2012). In addition to altered glucose metabolism, changes in amino acid metabolism also contribute to different aspects of tumorigenesis; for example, aberrant activation of the serine/glycine biosynthetic pathway is critical in cancer pathogenesis (Amelio et al , 2014). Restoring these altered metabolic pathways may be a new cancer therapeutic approach (Vander Heiden, 2011).\n\nGlutathione S-transferase zeta 1-1 (GSTZ1-1), also known as maleylacetoacetate isomerase (MAAI, EC 5.2.1.2), catalyzes the glutathione-dependent isomerization of maleylacetoacetate (MAA) to fumarylacetoacetate (FAA; Ferna \u00b4ndez-Can \u02dco \u00b4 n &amp; Pen \u02dcalva, 1998) and is the penultimate enzyme of phenylalanine/tyrosine (Phe/Tyr) catabolism. GSTZ1-1 is a member of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) superfamily, which catalyzes the reaction of glutathione with endoand xenobiotics, and thus plays a critical role in cellular detoxification (Allocati et al , 2018). Further, GSTZ1-1 catalyzes the oxygenation of dichloroacetic acid (DCA) to glyoxylic acid and plays a role in xenobiotic a -haloacid metabolism (Tong et al , 1998). Gstz1 /C0 / /C0 mice accumulated FAA and succinylacetone (SA) in the urine. When stressed with a high-Phe diet, these mice showed rapid\n\nweight loss, renal and hepatic damage, necrosis, and lethality (Ferna \u00b4ndez-Can \u02dco \u00b4 n et al , 2002). Deficiency of GSTZ1-1 in mice causes constitutive oxidative stress and suggests the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) antioxidant response pathway (Blackburn et al , 2006). Recently, GSTZ1-1 was reported to be downregulated in HCC and upregulated in breast cancer (Jahn et al , 2016), indicating that dysregulation of GSTZ1-1 may be involved in the tumorigenesis in humans. However, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown.\n\nNRF2, a master regulator of detoxification and the antioxidant response, is also involved in the regulation of metabolism and other essential cellular functions. It has been recognized as a driver of cancer progression, metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapy (Rojo de la Vega et al , 2018). The cysteine-rich protein kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), a central negative regulator of NRF2, is a substrate adaptor protein for cullin-3-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase and is responsible for NRF2 ubiquitylation and degradation. Under exposure to electrophiles or oxidative stress, several cysteine residues on KEAP1 are alkylated or oxidized, which results in a conformational change, enabling the dissociation of NRF2. NRF2 then translocates into the nucleus to induce expression of its target genes, such as NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase 1 (HO1), and glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic/modifier subunit (GCLC/M) , through binding to the antioxidant responsive element (ARE) in the promoter regions of these genes (Nioi et al , 2003; Hayes et al , 2015).\n\nIn the present study, we found that the expression of GSTZ1-1 is downregulated in HCC cell lines and tumor tissues, and Gstz1 /C0 / /C0 mice showed increased hepatocarcinogenesis following chemical carcinogen exposure. Moreover, we investigated whether GSTZ1-1 deficiency can upregulate IGF1R expression, activate IGF1Rmediated antiapoptotic pathway, and promote HCC progression. Here, we show that GSTZ1-1 serves as a tumor suppressor in HCC and provide an alternative mechanism by which an oncometabolite may activate the IGF1R pathway.\n",

EpCAM-positive and EpCAM-negative tumors shared 398 probes, corresponding to 348 genes that were differentially expressed between cancer and control tissues. Pathway analysis demonstrated that the differentially expressed genes were enriched in 26 pathways, including bile secretion, retinol metabolism, and tyrosine metabolism (Appendix Fig S1). One of the candidate genes (Table EV1), GSTZ1 (belonging to tyrosine metabolism), was selected for further study.\n\nWe further analyzed GSTZ1 mRNA expression in an independent cohort of 363 HCC tissues (including 50 paired tumor and normal liver tissues) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. GSTZ1 mRNA expression was significantly decreased in tumor tissues compared with normal liver tissues ( P &lt; 0.001; Fig 1A). Decreased GSTZ1-1 expression was associated with advanced tumor stage in the TCGA database (stage I/II versus stage III/IV, P = 0.005; Fig 1B). Kaplan -Meier's survival curve analysis demonstrated that patients with low expression of GSTZ1-1 had lower overall survival than patients with high expression of GSTZ1-1 (median survival, 1,372 versus 2,131 days, P = 0.008; Fig 1C).\n\nNext, we examined GSTZ1-1 expression in 40 paired clinical HCC and normal tissue samples. Quantitative RT -PCR (qRT -PCR), Western blotting, and immunohistochemical (IHC) assay revealed that GSTZ1 mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly lower in HCC than in the corresponding non-tumor tissues (Fig 1D -F). Collectively, these data indicated that downregulation of GSTZ1-1 in HCC may contribute to disease progression and predicts poor prognosis."

We constructed a recombinant adenovirus encoding GSTZ1 (AdGSTZ1) to overexpress GSTZ1-1 (GSTZ1-OE), and an adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein (AdGFP) was used as a control. In addition, we established GSTZ1 knockout (GSTZ1-KO) HepG2 cell lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (Fig EV1). Overexpression and knockout efficiencies were confirmed by immunoblot assay (Fig 2B). GSTZ1-OE significantly repressed the proliferation of both Huh7 and SK-Hep1 cells, as shown by EdU incorporation, MTS, and colony formation assays, whereas GSTZ1-KO promoted HepG2 cell proliferation (Fig 2C -E).\n\nTo examine whether such effects exist in vivo , AdGSTZ1-, AdGFP-, or mock-infected MHCC-97H cells were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of nude mice. Xenograft tumors in the AdGSTZ1 group were significantly smaller than those in the AdGFP and mock control groups (Fig EV2A and B). Accordingly, xenograft weight was significantly lower in the AdGSTZ1 group ( P &lt; 0.001; Fig EV2C). Together, these results suggested that GSTZ1-1 can repress HCC cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo ."

            "content": "Gstz1 /C0 / /C0 mice exhibit increased oxidative stress and activation of antioxidant response pathways (Blackburn et al , 2006). Thus, we evaluated the effect of GSTZ1-1 on the NRF2 activation. GSTZ1-OE decreased ARE luciferase activity, NRF2 nuclear translocation, and expression levels of NRF2 target genes, including NQO1, multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2), GCLM, thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), and HO1 (Fig 3A -C top, and Fig EV3A). In contrast, GSTZ1-KO promoted activation of NRF2 antioxidant pathway (Fig 3A -C bottom). These data indicated that loss of GSTZ1-1 leads to NRF2 activation.\n\nTo gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying NRF2 activation, Gstz1 /C0 / /C0 mice on 129SvJ background were obtained from the European Mouse Mutant Archive. Consistent with previous studies (Ferna \u00b4ndez-Can \u02dco \u00b4 n et al , 2002), we\n\n## Figure 2 .

Metabolites of Phe/Tyr catabolism in the murine liver were analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QqQMS). Prior to liver tissue collection, mice were supplemented with 2% (w/v) Phe in their drinking water for 1 week. UHPLC-QqQ-MS analysis indicated that SA concentrations in Gstz1 /C0 / /C0 mouse livers were 4.5-fold higher than those in WT mouse livers (Fig 3D). These results suggested that loss of GSTZ1-1 resulted in SA accumulation and NRF2 activation.\n\nWe then checked whether treatment with Phe and SA could activate the NRF2 signaling pathway in HepG2 cells. Based on a luciferase activity, either Phe (2.0 mM) or SA (200 l M) activated ARE-based transcription (Fig 3E). Immunoblotting showed that the expression of nuclear NRF2 protein as well as its downstream target NQO1 was dramatically increased in HepG2 cells in the presence of Phe or SA (Fig 3F). These results indicated that overloading of the Phe/Tyr catabolic pathway activated the KEAP1/ NRF2 pathway."

We assumed that SA may activate NRF2 by alkylation of KEAP1 cysteine residues, similar to cysteine modification by fumarate (Adam et al , 2011) or itaconate (Mills et al , 2018). To analyze KEAP1 alkylation directly, GSTZ1-KO HepG2 cells were transfected with Flag-tagged KEAP1 and then treated with Phe (final concentration, 2.0 mM). MS analysis of Flagimmunoprecipitated KEAP1 identified SA modification at residues Cys23, Cys319, Cys406, and Cys513 (Table EV2, Figs 3G, and EV4). Next, we checked Myc-tagged NRF2 (NRF2-Myc) expression in HepG2 cells co-expressing WT KEAP1 or C23S, C151S, C319S, C406S, or C513S mutant KEAP1. SA stabilized NRF2-Myc in HepG2 cells co-expressing WT KEAP1, but not in HepG2 cells co-expressing C151S and C406S mutant KEAP1. Replacing C23, C319, or C513 with serine generated nonfunctional KEAP1 mutants, which could not mediate degradation of NRF2-Myc, even without SA treatment (Fig 3H). These site-directed mutagenesis experiments indicated that C406 and C151 of KEAP1 play a critical role in sensing SA. However, our MS analysis did not identify SA modification at C151. Together, these results demonstrated that accumulation of SA contributed to NRF2 activation via alkylating KEAP1 cysteine residues."

Functional studies indicated that GSTZ1 knockout promoted proliferation. The accelerated cell growth in HepG2 cells lacking GSTZ1-1 was considerably abated by PPP in a dosedependent manner, indicating the essential role of IGF1R in HCC tumorigenesis by GSTZ1-1 depletion (Fig 5A and B). To examine whether the growth-inhibition effect of GSTZ1-1 is associated with apoptosis, we measured apoptosis induction by examining the apoptotic ratio of HCC cells. The flow cytometry assays revealed the percentage of early apoptotic cells remarkably increased ( P &lt; 0.0001) in GSTZ1-OE Huh7 cells, while it decreased significantly ( P = 0.0065) in GSTZ1-KO cells. Consistently, PPP treatment induced obvious apoptotic induction in GSTZ1-1-deficient HepG2 cells (Figs 5C and EV5A). These data suggested that tumor-promotion effects by GSTZ1-1 depletion might be related to IGF1Rmediated antiapoptotic pathway.\n\nOur data obtained by RNA sequencing and qRT -PCR indicated that differential expression of IGF1R, and its downstream signaling molecules and apoptosis-associated genes, was consistent with GSTZ1-1-induced apoptotic phenotype (Fig 5D -E).

Previous studies suggested that antiapoptotic effect of IGF1R is mediated by PI3K/AKT and Ras/ERK signaling pathways through the BCL2-associated death protein (BAD) and cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) (phosphorylated at Ser133; Datta et al , 1997; Wang et al , 1999). We found that GSTZ1-OE cells exhibited lower phosphorylation levels of AKT, ERK, BAD, and CREB. Moreover, increased cleavage of both cysteine aspartic acid specific protease 9 (caspase 9) and caspase 3, but decreased levels of the antiapoptotic protein B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 protein (BCL2), was observed in GSTZ1-OE cells (Fig 5F -G). On the contrary, GSTZ1-1 ablation altered AKT, ERK, BAD, CREB phosphorylation, and apoptosis-associated gene expression in an opposite way (Fig 5F -G). To confirm the role of IGF1R in the antiapoptotic effect of GSTZ1-1 deficiency in HCC cells, we pretreated GSTZ1-KO cells with the IGF1R inhibitor PPP or IGF1R shRNA. As expected, treatment with PPP or IGF1R shRNA blocked the antiapoptotic effect of GSTZ1-1 depletion in GSTZ1-1-deficient cells (Fig 5F -G). These results indicate that GSTZ1-1 mediated proapoptotic effects in HCC cells by suppressing the IGF1R signaling pathway."

For this, we analyzed the transcriptional activities and protein levels of IGF1R by regulating NRF2 activation in GSTZ1-KO and GSTZ1-OE HCC cells (Fig 6A -C). GSTZ1 knockout increased the luciferase activity of human IGF1R promoter and protein expression of IGF1R, but this effect was reversed by treatment with brusatol (Bru), an inhibitor of NRF2 (Fig 6A). Similar inhibitory effects on IGF1R transcription and expression were observed during overexpression of KEAP1 in GSTZ1-KO cells (Fig 6B). Conversely, GSTZ1-1 overexpression decreased IGF1R promoter activity and protein level, whereas treatment with the NRF2 activator tertiary butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) rescued these changes (Fig 6C). These results suggest that GSTZ1-1 affects the expression of IGF1R by regulating NRF2 activity.\n\nNext, we explored the underlying mechanisms of how NRF2 regulates IGF1R expression. NRF2 interacts with specificity protein 1 (SP1) (Gao et al , 2014), a major transcription factor of IGF1R ; therefore, we speculated that NRF2 may regulate IGF1R transcription by binding and recruiting SP1 to the IGF1R promoter region. To verify this hypothesis, we first assessed the interaction of NRF2 and SP1 proteins using co-immunoprecipitation assays in MHCC-97H cells. The results confirmed the interaction between NRF2 and SP1 (Fig 6D). Subsequently, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays also revealed that inactivation of NRF2 by Bru treatment blocked the recruitment of SP1, whereas NRF2 activator tBHQ increased SP1 binding to the IGF1R promoter (Fig 6E). Taken together, these data demonstrate that NRF2 activation, induced by GSTZ1 knockout, may function as a coactivator and promote IGF1R transcription via interaction with SP1.\n\nFurthermore, we examined whether treatment with Phe or SA regulates the expression levels of IGF1R and NRF2 in HCC cell lines. We found that exogenous Phe and SA loading dose-dependently increased the expression of IGF1R and NRF2 in HepG2 cells (Fig 6F). Nuclear translocation of NRF2, induced by treatment with Phe and SA, was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig 3F). Phe and SA increased the activity of human IGF1R promoter and promoted SP1 enrichment on the IGF1R promoter (Figs 6G and EV5B). Interestingly, 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione (NTBC), an inhibitor of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, which blocked the production of homogentisate and downstream metabolites, reversed Phe-mediated upregulation of IGF1R. However, it failed to inhibit IGF1R expression induced by SA (Fig 6H). Altogether, these findings suggest that SA accumulation, induced by GSTZ1 knockout, increased IGF1R expression via NRF2 activation and SP1 enrichment on the IGF1R promoter."
