High-content phenotypic screens such as Perturb-seq (CRISPR-based screens with single-cell RNA-sequencing readouts) enable massively parallel functional genomic mapping but, to date, have been used at limited scales. Here, we perform genome-scale Perturb-seq targeting all expressed genes with CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) across &gt;2.5 million human cells. We use transcriptional phenotypes to predict the function of poorly characterized genes, uncovering new regulators of ribosome biogenesis (including CCDC86 , ZNF236 , and SPATA5L1 ), transcription ( C7orf26 ), and mitochondrial respiration ( TMEM242 ). In addition to assigning gene function, single-cell transcriptional phenotypes allow for in-depth dissection of complex cellular phenomena-from RNA processing to differentiation. We leverage this ability to systematically identify genetic drivers and consequences of aneuploidy and to discover an unanticipated layer of stress-specific regulation of the mitochondrial genome. Our information-rich genotype-phenotype map reveals a multidimensional portrait of gene and cellular function.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nMapping the relationship between genetic changes and their phenotypic consequence is critical to understanding gene and cellular function. This mapping is traditionally carried out in one of two ways: a phenotype-centric, ''forward genetic'' approach that reveals the genetic changes that drive a phenotype of interest or a gene-centric, ''reverse genetic'' approach that catalogs the diverse phenotypes caused by a defined genetic change.\n\nRecent technological developments have advanced both forward and reverse genetic efforts (Camp et al., 2019). CRISPR tools now enable the deletion, mutation, repression, or activation\n\nof genes with ease (Doench, 2018). In forward genetic screens, CRISPR-Cas systems can be used to generate pools of cells with diverse genetic perturbations, which can then be subjected to selection followed by sequencing to assign phenotypes to genetic perturbations. Forward genetic screens are powerful tools for the identification of cancer dependencies, essential cellular machinery, differentiation factors, and suppressors of genetic diseases (Kramer et al., 2018; Tsherniak et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2021, 2015). In parallel, dramatic improvements in molecular phenotyping now allow for single-cell readouts of epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and imaging information (Stuart and Satija, 2019). Applied to reverse genetics, single-cell\n\nprofiling can refine the understanding of how select genetic perturbations affect cell types and cell states.\n\nHowever, both phenotype-centric and gene-centric approaches suffer conceptual and technical limitations. Pooled forward genetic screens typically use low-dimensional phenotypes such as growth or marker expression for selection. The use of simple phenotypes can conflate genes acting via different mechanisms, requiring extensive follow-up studies to disentangle genetic pathways (Przybyla and Gilbert, 2021). Additionally, in forward genetics, serendipitous discovery is constrained by the prerequisite of selecting phenotypes prior to screening. On the other hand, reverse genetic approaches enable the study of multidimensional and complex phenotypes but have typically been restricted in scale to rationally chosen targets, limiting systematic comparisons.\n\nAs a solution to these problems, single-cell CRISPR screens simultaneously read out the genetic perturbation and highdimensional phenotype of individual cells in a pooled format, thus combining the throughput of forward genetics with the rich phenotypes of reverse genetics. Although these approaches initially focused on transcriptomic phenotypes (e.g., Perturbseq, CROP-seq) (Adamson et al., 2016; Datlinger et al., 2017; Dixit et al., 2016; Jaitin et al., 2016; Replogle et al., 2020), technical advances have enabled their application to epigenetic (Rubin et al., 2019), imaging (Feldman et al., 2019), or multimodal phenotypes (Mimitou et al., 2019). From these rich data, it is possible to identify genetic perturbations that cause a specific behavior as well as to catalog the spectrum of phenotypes associated with each genetic perturbation. Despite the promise of single-cell CRISPR screens, their use has generally been limited to studying at most a few hundred genetic perturbations chosen to address predefined biological questions.\n\nWe reasoned that there would be unique value to genomescale single-cell CRISPR screens. For example, although the number of perturbations scales linearly with experimental cost, the number of pairwise comparisons in a screen-and thus its utility for unsupervised classification of gene function-scales quadratically. Similarly, in large-scale screens, the diversity of perturbations allows exploration of the range of cell states that can be revealed by rich phenotypes. Additionally, as many human genes are well characterized, these genes serve as natural controls to anchor interpretation of comprehensive datasets. Finally, genome-scale experiments could help address fundamental questions, such as what fraction of genetic changes elicit transcriptional phenotypes and how transcriptional responses differ between cell types, with implications for understanding organizing principles of cells.\n\nHere, we report results from the first genome-scale Perturbseq screens. We use a compact, multiplexed CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) library to assay thousands of loss-of-function genetic perturbations with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (K562) and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE1) cell lines. Leveraging the scale and diversity of these perturbations, we show that Perturb-seq can be used to study numerous complex cellular phenotypes-from RNA splicing to differentiation to chromosomal instability (CIN)-and discover gene functions. We then invert our analysis to focus on regulatory networks and\n\nuncover unanticipated stress-specific regulation of the mitochondrial genome. In sum, we use Perturb-seq to reveal a multidimensional portrait of cellular behavior, gene function, and regulatory networks that advances the goal of creating comprehensive genotype-phenotype maps.\n",

            "subtitle": "## A multiplexed CRISPRi strategy for genome-scale Perturb-seq",
            "content": "Perturb-seq uses scRNA-seq to concurrently read out the CRISPR single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) (i.e., genetic perturbation) and transcriptome (i.e., high-dimensional phenotype) of single cells in a pooled format (Figure 1A). We sought to exploit and understand the rich information content of transcriptomic phenotypes by studying a comprehensive set of genetic perturbations in a given cell type. To enable genome-scale Perturb-seq, we considered key parameters that would increase scalability and data quality, such as the genetic perturbation modality and sgRNA library.\n\nPerturb-seq is compatible with a range of CRISPR-based perturbations. We elected to use CRISPRi for several reasons: (1) Compared with gain-of-function perturbations, a higher proportion of loss-of-function perturbations yield phenotypes in growth and chemical-genetic screens, especially for members of protein complexes (Gilbert et al., 2014; Horlbeck et al., 2016). (2) CRISPRi allows direct measurement of the efficacy of genetic perturbation-knockdown-by scRNA-seq. Exploiting this feature allowed us to target each gene in our library with a single element and empirically exclude unperturbed genes from downstream analysis. (3) CRISPRi tends to yield more homogeneous perturbation than CRISPR knockout, which can generate active in-frame indels (Smits et al., 2019). The relative homogeneity of CRISPRi reduces selection for unperturbed cells, especially when studying essential genes. (4) Unlike CRISPR knockout, CRISPRi does not lead to activation of the DNA damage response which can alter transcriptional signatures (Haapaniemi et al., 2018).\n\nWefirst optimized our CRISPRi sgRNA libraries for scalability. To maximize CRISPRi efficacy, we used multiplexed CRISPRi libraries in which each element contains two distinct sgRNAs targeting the same gene (Table S1; Replogle et al., 2020). To avoid low representation of sgRNAs targeting essential genes, we performed growth screens and, during oligonucleotide library synthesis, overrepresented constructs that caused strong growth defects (Figures S1A-S1D).\n\nNext, we devised a three-pronged Perturb-seq screening approach encompassing multiple time points and cell types (Figure 1A). As a principal cell line, we studied CML K562 cells engineered to express the CRISPRi effector dCas9-KRAB (Gilbert et al., 2014). In this cell line, we performed two Perturb-seq screens: one targeting all expressed genes sampled 8 days after lentiviral transduction (n = 9,866 genes) and another targeting common essential genes sampled 6 days after transduction (n = 2,057 genes). As a secondary cell line, we used RPE1 cells engineered to express dCas9 fused to a ZIM3 -derived KRAB domain, which was recently shown to improve CRISPRi transcriptional repression (Alerasool et al., 2020), sampled 7 days\n\nafter transduction. In contrast to K562 cells, RPE1 cells are a non-cancerous, hTERT-immortalized, near-euploid, adherent, and p53-positive cell line.\n\nWe conducted all screens with 10x Genomics droplet-based 3 0 scRNA-seq and direct sgRNA capture (Replogle et al., 2020). After excluding cells bearing sgRNAs targeting different genes, which are an expected byproduct of lentiviral recombination between sgRNA cassette or doublet encapsulation during scRNA-seq, we retained &gt;2.5 million high-quality cells with a median coverage of &gt;100 cells per perturbation (Figures S1E-S1G; Table S2). We observed a median target knockdown of 85.5% in K562 cells and 91.6% in RPE1 cells (Figure 1B), confirming the efficacy of our CRISPRi libraries and the fidelity of sgRNA assignment."

            "subtitle": "## A robust computational framework to detect transcriptional phenotypes",
            "content": "Thescale of our experiment provided a unique opportunity to ask what fraction of genetic perturbations cause a transcriptional phenotype. Significant transcriptional phenotypes can take many forms, ranging from altered occupancy of cell states to focused changes in the expression of a small number of target genes. To contend with this diversity, we created a robust framework capable of detecting transcriptional changes. Our experimental design included many control cells bearing diverse non-targeting sgRNAs. These allowed for internal z -normalization of expression measurements to correct for batch effects resulting that resulted from parallelized scRNA-seq and sequencing (Data S1 [Figure i]). As Perturb-seq captures single-cell genetic perturbation identities in a pooled format, we can use statistical approaches that treat cells as independent samples. In general, we chose to use conservative, nonparametric statistical tests to detect transcriptional changes rather than making specific assumptions about the underlying distribution of gene expression levels.\n\nFirst, we examined global transcriptional changes using a permuted energy distance test (see STAR Methods). We compared cells bearing each genetic perturbation with control\n\ncells at the level of principal components (approximating global features like cell state and gene expression programs) to test whether cells carrying a given genetic perturbation could have been drawn from the control population. By this metric, 2,987 of 9,608 genetic perturbations targeting a primary transcript (31.1%) compared with 11 of 585 controls (1.9%) caused a significant transcriptional phenotype in K562 cells.\n\nAlthough sensitive, the energy distance test assays global shifts in expression without providing insight into which specific transcripts are altered. To detect individual differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we applied the Anderson-Darling (AD) test that is sensitive to transcriptional changes in a subset of cells, enabling us to find differences even with incomplete penetrance. By the AD test, 2,935 of 9,608 genetic perturbations targeting a primary transcript (30.5%) compared with 12 of 585 controls (2.1%) caused &gt;10 DEGs in K562 cells. These results were well-correlated between time points and cell types (Figures S2A and S2B; Tables S2) and concordant with the energy distance test (78.7% concordance by Jaccard index).\n\nWe then explored features of genetic perturbations that predict the likelihood of causing a transcriptional phenotype. The strength of transcriptional response was correlated with the growth phenotype (Spearman's r = /C0 0.51) with 86.6% of essential genetic perturbations leading to a significant transcriptional response (Figure 1C; Figures S2C and S2D). Nonetheless, a substantial number of genetic perturbations that cause a transcriptional phenotype have a negligible growth phenotype (n = 771; Figure S2E), indicating that many genetic perturbations influence cell state but not growth or survival. Genes whose knockdown caused strong transcriptional phenotypes were more likely to be highly expressed, to have an annotated subcellular localization, and to be components of core protein complexes (Figures S2F-S2L).\n\nAs some of our genetic perturbations did not yield strong ontarget knockdown, our estimate of the fraction of genetic perturbations that cause a transcriptional phenotype is likely a lower bound. Although some phenotypes may result from off-target effects, Perturb-seq allows direct detection of off-target activities such as neighboring gene knockdown. Consistent with earlier studies (Rosenbluh et al., 2017), /C24 7.5% of perturbations caused knockdown of a neighboring gene, but neighbor gene knockdown was not enriched in perturbations with a negligible growth defect that produced a transcriptional phenotype (Figure S3)."

            "subtitle": "## Annotating gene function from transcriptional phenotypes",
            "content": "Previous Perturb-seq screens focused on targeted sets of perturbations, such as genes identified in forward genetic screens. Our screen targeting all expressed genes in K562 cells presented an opportunity to assess how well transcriptional phenotypes can resolve gene function when used in an unbiased manner.\n\nWe focused on a subset of 1,973 perturbations that had strong transcriptional phenotypes (Figure 2A). Because related perturbations could have different magnitudes of effect, we used the correlation between mean expression profiles as a scale-invariant metric of similarity. To assess the extent to which correlated expression profiles between genetic pertur-\n\nbations indicated common function, we compared our results with two curated sources of biological relationships. First, among the 1,973 targeted genes, there were 327 protein complexes from CORUM3.0 with at least two thirds of the complex members present, representing 14,165 confirmed proteinprotein interactions (Giurgiu et al., 2019). The corresponding expression profile correlations were stronger (median r = 0.61) than the background distribution of all possible gene pairs (median r = 0.10) (Figure 2B). Second, high correlation between expression profiles was strongly associated with high STRING protein-protein interaction confidence scores (Figure 2C; Szklarczyk et al., 2019).\n\nWenext performed an unbiased clustering of similar perturbations within the dataset. We identified 64 discrete clusters and annotated their function using CORUM, STRING, and manual searches. To visualize the dataset, we constructed a minimum distortion embedding that places genes with correlated expression profiles nearby (Figure 2D). The clusters and embedding showed clear organization by biological function spanning an array of processes including: chromatin modification; transcription; mRNA splicing, capping, polyadenylation, and turnover; nonsense-mediated decay; translation; posttranslational modification, trafficking, and degradation of proteins; central metabolism; mitochondrial transcription and translation; DNA replication; cell division; microRNA biogenesis; and major signaling pathways (Table S3).\n\nNext, we compared the similarity of transcriptional phenotypes between all three Perturb-seq datasets. For K562 cells sampled at day 8 versus day 6, both the relationships between perturbations (cophenetic correlation = 0.82) and phenotypes (median r = 0.50) were highly similar (Figures S4A and S4B). By contrast, the K562 and RPE1 datasets had more divergent relationships (cophenetic correlation = 0.37) and phenotypes (median r = 0.23) (Figures S4B-S4E).\n\nIn our dataset, perturbation of many poorly annotated genes led to similar transcriptional responses to genes of known function, naturally predicting a role for these uncharacterized genes. To test these predictions, we selected ten poorly annotated genes whose perturbation response correlated with subunits and biogenesis factors of either the large or small subunit of the cytosolic ribosome (Figure S4F). This included genes that had no previous association with ribosome biogenesis ( CCDC86 , CINP , SPATA5L1 , ZNF236 , and C1orf131 ) as well as genes that had not been associated with functional defects in a particular subunit ( SPOUT1 , TMA16 , NOPCHAP1 , ABCF1 , and NEPRO ). CRISPRi-mediated depletion of nine of the ten candidate factors led to substantial defects in ribosome biogenesis, with the exception of ABCF1 , as assessed by the ratio of 28S to 18S rRNA (Figure 2E). In every case, the affected ribosomal subunit corresponded to the Perturb-seq clustering across two independent sgRNAs. Although this study was in progress, another group identified C1orf131 as a structural component of the pre-A1 small subunit processome by cryoEM, complementing our functional work (Singh et al., 2021). This validation suggests that many poorly characterized genes can be assigned functional roles through Perturb-seq, although a subset of these relationships may be explained by off-target effects (Figure S4G and S4H)."

            "subtitle": "## Delineating functional modules of the Integrator complex",
            "content": "In general, perturbations to members of known protein complexes produced similar transcriptional phenotypes in our data. Therefore, we were surprised that knockdown of the 14 core subunits of Integrator, a metazoan-specific essential nuclear complex with roles in small nuclear RNA (snRNA) biogenesis and transcription termination, led to variable responses (Figure 3A; Kirstein et al., 2021). INTS1 , INTS2 , INTS5 , INTS7 , and INTS8 formed a tight cluster that weakly correlated with INTS6\n\nand INTS12 (Figure 3B; Data S2 [Figure i]). Separately, INTS3 , INTS4 , INTS9 , and INTS11 clustered together alongside splicing regulators. Finally, INTS10 , INTS13 , and INTS14 formed a discrete cluster together with C7orf26 , an uncharacterized gene.\n\nThese functional modules mirror the architecture observed in recent structures (Fianu et al., 2021; Zheng et al., 2020). The INTS1-2-5-7-8 module contained the subunits identified as the structural shoulder and backbone. The INTS3-4-9-11 module contained the structural cleavage subunits. Although INTS10, INTS13, and INTS14 were not resolved in recent cryo-EM Integrator structures, these subunits have been identified as a stable biochemical subcomplex (Pfleiderer and Galej, 2021; Sabath et al., 2020).\n\nIntegrator is well studied; hence, we were intrigued by the clustering of the uncharacterized gene C7orf26 with Integrator subunits 10, 13, and 14. To explore this, we tested whether loss of C7orf26 impacted Integrator subunit abundance. CRISPRi-mediated depletion of C7orf26 destabilized INTS10 (Figure 3C). Pulldown of His-INTS10 from cell lysates recovered endogenous C7orf26 alongside INTS13 and INTS14 (Figure 3D), indicative of a biochemical interaction consistent with previous reports (Boeing et al., 2016; Malovannaya et al., 2010). Overexpression of C7orf26 with INTS10, INTS13, and INTS14 enabled the purification of a stable INTS10-13-14-C7orf26 complex by size-exclusion chromatography (Figure 3E; Data S2 [Figures i and ii]). We also detected an interaction between the Drosophila C7orf26 ortholog and fly Integrator and observed co-essentiality between C7orf26 and INTS10, INTS13, and INTS14 in the Cancer Dependency Map (Data S2 [Figure iii]) (Pan et al., 2022; Wainberg et al., 2021). These results suggest that C7orf26 is a core subunit of an INTS10-13-14-C7orf26 Integrator module.\n\nWe sought to better understand the distinct transcriptional phenotypes induced by loss of Integrator modules. As comparison of DEGs between modules did not reveal function (Data S2 [Figure i]), we next explored the canonical role of Integrator using changes in splicing as a proxy for snRNA biogenesis defects. We examined splicing by comparing the ratio of unspliced with spliced reads for each gene in our Perturb-seq data. Validating our approach, depletion of known splicing factors as well as subunits of the cleavage and shoulder/backbone modules led to gross splicing defects (Figure 3F). By contrast, depletion of subunits of the INTS10-13-14-C7orf26 module did not cause a substantial splicing defect. To directly test the effect of the INTS1013-14-C7orf26 module on snRNA biogenesis, we used precision run-on sequencing (PRO-seq) to probe active RNA-polymerase positioning and confirmed that extended knockdown of the cleavage and backbone/shoulder modules, but not INTS10 , INTS13 , or C7orf26 , caused a dramatic increase in transcriptional readthrough past the 3 0 cleavage site of snRNAs (Figure 3G; Data S2 [Figure i]).\n\ncurrent studies (Figure 3H; Funk et al., 2021; Pan et al., 2022; Wainberg et al., 2021). Although Integrator has been subjected to extensive structural analyses, it has been difficult to resolve the INTS10-13-14 components in relation to the rest of the complex, and inclusion of C7orf26 may facilitate future structural efforts. We propose that C7orf26 be renamed INTS15 ."

            "subtitle": "## Data-driven definition of transcriptional programs",
            "content": "Although clustering can organize genetic perturbations into pathways or complexes, it does not reveal the functional consequences of perturbations. To summarize the genotype-phenotype relationships in our data, we (1) clustered genes into expression programs based on their co-regulation, (2) clustered perturbations based on their transcriptional profiles, and (3) computed the average activity of each gene expression program within each perturbation cluster (Figures 4A and 4B; Figure S5A; Table S3; see STAR Methods). This map uncovered many known expression programs associated with perturbations, including upregulation of proteasomal subunits due to proteasome dysfunction (Radhakrishnan et al., 2010), activation of NFk B signaling upon loss of ESCRT proteins (Mami /C19 nska et al., 2016), and upregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis in response to defects in vesicular trafficking (Luo et al., 2020). Our analysis also delineated the canonical branches of the cellular stress response into the unfolded protein response (UPR), activated by the loss of ER-resident chaperones and translocation machinery, and integrated stress response (ISR), activated by loss of mitochondrial proteins, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and translation initiation factors (Figure 4C; Adamson et al., 2016).\n\nInterestingly, our clustering uncovered many perturbations that drove the expression of markers of erythroid or myeloid differentiation, consistent with the multilineage potential of K562 cells (Figure4D;Learyetal.,1987).Asexpected,lossofcentralregulatorsof erythropoiesis ( GATA1 , LDB1 , LMO2 , and KDM1A ) caused myeloid differentiation, whereas knockdown of BCR-ABL and its adaptor GAB2 induced erythroid differentiation (Orkin and Zon, 2008). Next, we investigated the differentiation effect of selectively essential genes, which could be promising targets for differentiation therapy, analogous to KDM1A (Maes et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2021). We observed that loss of PTPN1 , a tyrosine phosphatase selectively essential in K562 cells, drove myeloid differentiation. In targeted experiments, we found that combined knockdown of PTPN1 and KDM1A causedasubstantialincreaseindifferentiation and growth defect compared with knockdown of either gene individually, suggesting that these targets act via different cellular mechanisms (Figure 4E; Figure S5B). These results highlight the utility of rich phenotypes for understanding differentiation as well as nominating therapeutic targets."

We found numerous composite phenotypes under strong genetic control, with reproducible effects across replicates and cell types (Figure 4F).\n\nIn the case of TE regulation, two classes of perturbations increased the fraction of TE RNA by affecting broad classes of elements including Alu, L1, and MIR (Figure 4G; Figure S5C). First, loss of exosome subunits increased the fraction of TE RNA, suggesting that transcripts deriving from TEs might be preferentially degraded. Second, loss of the CPSF and Integrator complexes produced a similar phenotype, suggesting that TE RNAsmayderivefrom failure of normal transcription termination.\n\nTurning to total RNA content, we found that loss of regulators of S-phase and mitosis increased the RNA content of cells (Figure 4H). This is consistent with the observation that cells tend to increase their size and thus their RNA content, as they progress through the cell cycle (Figure S5D). By contrast, loss of transcriptional machinery, including general transcription factors, Mediator, and transcription elongation factors, decreased total RNA content. In sum, these analyses show that Perturb-seq enables hypothesis-driven exploration of complex cellular features."

            "content": "Wenext reasoned that exploring sources of single-cell heterogeneity could reveal insights that are missed in bulk or averaged measurements. To assess the penetrance of perturbationinduced phenotypes, we applied SVD-based leverage scores as a metric of single-cell phenotypic magnitude (see STAR Methods). Leverage scores quantify how outlying each perturbed cell's transcriptome is relative to control cells without assuming that perturbations drive a single axis of variation. Supporting this approach, mean leverage scores for each genetic perturbation were correlated with the number of DEGs (Figure S6A, Spearman's r = 0.71) and reproducible across experiments (Figure S6B, Spearman's r = 0.79). We then scored perturbations by the variation in single-cell leverage scores (Figure 5A). Comparing leverage scores across complex subunits revealed evidence for both biological (e.g., subcomplex function or dosage imbalance) and technical (e.g., selection to escape toxic perturbations) sources of phenotypic heterogeneity (Figures S6C-S6F).\n\nIntriguingly, many genes implicated in chromosome segregation were among the top drivers of heterogeneity, including TTK , SPC25 , and DSN1 (Figure 5B; Musacchio and Salmon, 2007). We hypothesized that the extreme transcriptional variability caused by these genetic perturbations might result from acute changes in the copy number of chromosomes due to mitotic mis-segregation. To explore this, we used inferCNV (Patel et al., 2014) to estimate single-cell DNA copy number along the genome. Consistent with our hypothesis, knockdown of TTK , a core component of the spindle assembly checkpoint (Jelluma et al., 2008), led to dramatic changes in chromosome copy number in both intrinsically aneuploid K562 and near-euploid RPE1 cells (Figure 5C; Figure S7A). In RPE1 cells, we found that 61/80 (76%) of TTK knockdown cells had karyotypic changes compared with 274/13,140 (2%) of unperturbed cells. Notably, TTK knockdown cells bore highly variable karyotypes\n\ndue to the stochastic gain or loss of chromosomes, accounting for their phenotypic heterogeneity (Figure 5C).\n\nPerturb-seq further allows us to dissect relationships between cellular phenotypes. We were curious how CIN would affect cellcycle progression in p53-positive RPE1 cells versus p53deficient K562 cells. Considering all cells in our experiment independent of genetic perturbation, RPE1 cells with abnormal karyotypes tended to arrest in G1 or G0 of the cell cycle (G1 or G0 fraction 0.68 for abnormal karyotype versus 0.44 for stable karyotype), whereas K562 cells with altered karyotypes had less significant shifts in cell-cycle occupancy (Figures 5D and 5E). Within the population of RPE1 cells bearing a chromosome loss, the likelihood of cell cycle arrest directly depended on the magnitude of karyotypic abnormality (Figure S7B). Additionally, cells with the most severe karyotypic changes-those bearing both chromosome gains and losses-had marked upregulation of the ISR (Figures 5F and S7C). These results are consistent with models in which cell-cycle checkpoints are activated by the secondary consequences of aneuploidy (e.g., DNA damage or proteostatic stress) rather than changes in chromosome number per se (Santaguida and Amon, 2015; Santaguida et al., 2017).\n\nFinally, to systematically identify drivers of CIN, we assigned a score to each perturbation based on the average magnitude of induced karyotypic abnormalities. CIN scores were strongly correlated across K562 and RPE1 cell lines (r = 0.69) and identified many known regulators of chromosome segregation (Figure 5G). Remarkably, we uncovered CIN regulators with diverse cellular roles, from cytoskeletal components to DNA repair machinery (Figure 5H; Table S2). This analysis also shows the potential of single-cell CRISPR screens to dissect phenotypes that were not predefined endpoints of the experiment."

            "content": "Mitochondria arose from the engulfment and endosymbiotic evolution of an ancestral alphaproteobacterium (Friedman and Nunnari, 2014). Although the majority ( /C24 99%) of mitochondrially localized proteins are encoded in the nuclear genome, mitochondria contain a small ( /C24 16.6 kb) remnant of their ancestral genome encoding 2 rRNAs, 22 tRNAs, and 13 protein-coding genes in humans. An open question is how expression of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes is coordinated to cope with mitochondrial stress (Quiro \u00b4 s et al., 2016). The scale of our experiment provided a unique opportunity to investigate this question.\n\nWebeganbycomparing the nuclear transcriptional responses with CRISPRi-based depletion of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes (i.e., mitochondrial perturbations). Mitochondrial perturbations elicited relatively homogeneous nuclear transcriptional responses (Figures 6A and S8A). Although there was some variation in magnitude (e.g., proteostatic injury drove especially strong ISR activation), nuclear transcriptional responses generally did not discriminate perturbations by function, consistent with recent literature that has highlighted the role of the ISR in mitochondrial stress (Fessler et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2020; Mick et al., 2020; Mu \u00a8 nch and Harper, 2016; Quiro \u00b4 s et al., 2017).\n\nIn contrast to the nuclear transcriptional response, the expression of mitochondrially encoded genes was highly variable\n\nbetween different mitochondrial perturbations (Figure 6B; Figures S8B-S8D). When we clustered mitochondrial perturbations based solely on expression of the 13 mitochondrially en- coded genes, a pattern emerged: the clustering separated perturbations to complex I, complex IV, complex III, complex V, the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit, the mitochondrial\n\nsmall ribosomal subunit, chaperones/import machinery, and RNA processing factors (Figure 6C; Figure S8E). In quantitative support of this observation, the mitochondrial transcriptome was far more predictive than the nuclear transcriptome in a random forest classifier trained to distinguish perturbations to different mitochondrial complexes (mitochondrial accuracy 0.64; nuclear accuracy: 0.25) (Figure S8F). We then visualized the expression signatures of a subset of representative perturbations (Figure 6D). The co-regulation of mitochondrial genes tended to reflect function, with the exception of the bicistronic mRNAs ND4L/ND4 and ATP8/ATP6 (Mercer et al., 2011). Although previous studies have described distinct regulation of the mitochondrial genome in response to specific perturbations (Richter-Dennerlein et al., 2016; Salvatori et al., 2020), our data generalize this phenomenon to a comprehensive set of stressors.\n\nNext, we wanted to shed light on the mechanistic basis for the complexity of mitochondrial genome responses. The mitochondrial genome is expressed by unique processes (Figure 7A; Kummer and Ban, 2021): mitochondrially encoded genes are transcribed as part of three polycistronic transcripts punctuated by tRNAs. These transcripts are then processed into rRNAs and mRNAs by tRNA excision, and individual mRNAs can be polyadenylated, translated, or degraded. This system limits the potential for transcriptional control but presents multiple opportunities for post-transcriptional regulation. To identify modes of perturbation-elicited differential expression, we examined the distribution of scRNA-seq reads along the mitochondrial genome (Figure 7B). To validate the utility of this position-based analysis, we confirmed that knockdown of known regulators of mitochondrial transcription ( TEFM ) and RNA degradation ( PNPT1 ) led to major shifts in the position of reads along the mitochondrial genome. By contrast, many of the perturbations in our study appeared to cause shifts in the relative abundance of mRNAs rather than gross shifts in positional alignments. To determine whether the observed mitochondrial genome responses reflected regulation of the total level of mitochondrial mRNAs or specific regulation of mRNA polyadenylation, we performed bulk RNA sequencing without poly-A selection. We observed perturbation-specific changes in the level of total RNA similar to those measured by scRNA-seq (cophenetic correlation = 0.79; Figure 7C). Given the complexity of the observed responses, we propose that there are likely to be multiple mechanisms that impact the levels of the various mitochondrially encoded transcripts in response to different stressors.\n\nFinally, we asked whether we could use the clustering produced by the mitochondrial genome to predict gene function. Knockdown of an unannotated gene, TMEM242 , produced a signature resembling loss of ATP synthase (Figure 7D; Figure S8G). Supporting this relationship, the top five co-essential genes with TMEM242 were components of ATP synthase in\n\nthe Cancer Dependency Map, and in a Seahorse assay, basal respiration was decreased upon TMEM242 knockdown (Figure 7E). Although this work was in progress, another group used a biochemical approach to show that TMEM242 regulates ATP synthase complex assembly (Carroll et al., 2021). Together, these experiments highlight a novel factor required for ATP synthase activity."
