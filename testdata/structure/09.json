A blood single-cell RNA sequencing dataset for seven supercentenarians (SCs) was recently generated. Here, we generate a reference 28sample aging cohort to compute a single-cell level aging clock and to determine the biological age of SCs. Our clock model placed the SCs at a blood biological age to between 80.43 and 102.67 years. Compared to the model-expected aging trajectory, SCs display increased naive CD8 + T cells, decreased cytotoxic CD8 + T cells, memory CD4 + T cells, and megakaryocytes. As the most prominent molecular hallmarks at the single-cell level, SCs contain more cells and cell types with high ribosome level, which is associated with and, according to Bayesian network inference, contributes to a low inflammation state and slow aging of SCs. Inhibiting ribosomal activity or translation in monocytes validates such translation against inflammation balance revealed by our single-cell aging clock.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nAging is a complex process of functional decline of an organism, which is accompanied by many degenerative diseases. Aging clocks refer to linear or nonlinear models trained on omics data to predict age and aging rate, which, measured by the difference between chronological and predicted age (AgeDiff), can be used to quantify aging at different levels ( 1 ). For example, human peripheral blood transcriptome clocks have a mean absolute difference (MAD) between chronological age and predicted age of 7.8 years ( 2 ), while blood proteome -based prediction reaches a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) between predicted and actual age of 0.93 to 0.97 ( 3 ), and DNA methylome has reached MAD of 4.9 years in the whole blood ( 4 ) and 3.6 years in heterogeneous tissues ( 5 ). A recent 50 blood cytokine -based immune aging clock has a MAD of 15.2 years ( 6 ). We have established a three-dimensional human facial image -based linear model with MAD of 6.1 years ( 7 ) and a deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) model of 2.8 years ( 8 ). Fast or slow agers (AgeDiff &gt; MAD) display substantial agingrelated physiological decline or delay than well predicted individuals ( 2 -7 ). However, how much of the heterogeneity in aging rate is contributed by the heterogeneity at the single-cell level has not been examined. Although a few single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses comparing two points of age (young and old) have found many age-related single-cell level changes in human and monkey ovary ( 9 , 10 ), and various tissues in mice ( 11 -17 ), the two points\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Several singlecell clocks have been developed in mice including multi-tissue single-cell DNA methylation clocks ( 18 ) and brain single-cell aging clocks ( 19 ). While 45-sample human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) scRNA-seq data across different ages are available ( 20 ), the quality and sparsity of the data do not allow reliable separation of known cell types or clear mapping of cell identities, in addition to the lack of precise age information.\n\nAvery small group of individuals, the supercentenarians (SCs), &gt;110 years old, not only achieve super longevity but also have a disease-free healthy and active life even at very old age. Recently, a precious blood scRNA-seq for 7 SCs was generated ( 21 ); however, without a quantitative aging clock model, there is no proper control or reference to decipher SCs ' cellular and molecular features associated with their extreme longevity, as neither young nor old samples can be rationally used for comparison. Specifically, due to the lack of a natural aging cohort to establish single-cell aging clock, it was not possible to examine what single-cell aging features were delayed or reversed in these SCs, and what were the biological ages of the SCs compared to the common single-cell aging trajectories, or what allow them move into a different aging trajectory. To address these problems, here we generated a 17-sample human PBMC scRNA-seq dataset from volunteers in Shanghai, China, evenly distributed from age 28 to 77 years, which we termed the Shanghai East Hospital natural aging cohort (or SE cohort for short). On the basis of the cell type composition changes in SE cohort and another cohort aged from 72 to 100 years ( 22 ), we built a linear aging clock, then applied to SCs, and revealed the cellular and molecular hallmarks deviating SCs ' actual age from the model-predicted age at the single-cell and cell type level (Fig. 1A).\n",

            "content": "To build a single-cell transcriptome -based aging rate predictor, we collected the PBMCs from 17 individuals (6 males and 11 females with similar age distributions) from 28 to 77 years of age, which we termed the Shanghai East Hospital natural aging cohort (or SE cohort for short), and subjected them to 10X Genomics scRNAseq. For each individual, an average of 8545 cells were sequenced and analyzed with an average of 110,364 reads per cell (Fig. 1A). We processed these data together with published PBMC scRNAseq datasets for further analysis. These include two Chinese cohorts, Chinese young cohort (CYCT) ( 23 ) and Wuhan cohort (WHCT) ( 24 ), and two Japanese cohorts, Japanese old cohort (JOCT) and SCs ( 21 ). Each of the cohorts contains five individuals. After removing 25,111 cells due to poor quality (cells with &gt;10% mitochondrial gene expression or &lt;200 genes detected), a total of 131,972 single cells (average of 7763 cells per sample) are retained for the SE datasets and a total of 23,796 cells for CYCT, 45,923 cells for WHCT, 19,252 cells for JOCT, and 38,417 cells for SC (fig. S1A). We then removed batch effect between SE datasets and other independent cohorts, and identified red blood cells (RBCs), megakaryocytes (Mega), and six major immune cell lineages -CD4 + T cells (TC), CD8 + T cells, natural killer cells (NK), monocytes (MC), and dendritic cells (DC), based on the expression of canonical lineage markers and cluster-specific marker genes, and visualized them by Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) (Fig. 1B). The presence of cells from both SE datasets and other independent datasets in each cluster demonstrates that all clusters contained cells from multiple samples and thus are not segregated due to dataset-specific batch effects (fig. S1B)."

Using the most significantly up-regulated genes in each cluster, we identified 29 cell subtypes in total. The CD4 + T cells were subdivided into five classes: CCR7 high naive CD4 + T cells (CD4 Naive), CCR7 high NECTIN1 high naive CD4 + T cells (CD4 NaiveNECTIN1), CCR7 med CCR6 -memory CD4 + T cells (CD4 Tm), CCR6 + effector memory CD4 + T cells (CD4 Tem), and FOXP3 + regulatory T cells (CD4 Treg) (Fig. 1B and fig. S1, C and D). The CD8 + T cells were subdivided into four classes: CCR7 + naive CD8 + T cells (CD8 Naive), GZMK + effector memory CD8 + T cells (CD8 Tem), GZMB + GNLY + cytotoxic CD8 + TCs (CD8 CTL), and DLG5 high cytotoxic CD8 + TCs (CD8 CTL-DLG5) (Fig. 1B and fig. S1, C and D). The NKs were subdivided into six subtypes by the most significantly up-regulated genes in each cluster (fig. S1C). In addition, we identified six major B cell subsets: two groups of IL4R + IGHD + naive B cells (Naive B and Naive B-NRGN); two groups of CD27 + IGHG1 + memory B cells (Memory B-IL32 and Memory B-CRIP1); plasma cells or socalled antibody-secreting cells, expressing high level of immunoglobulin genes MZB1; and a subset of ITGAX + B cells defined as age-associated B cells (ABCs) (Fig. 1B and fig. S1, E and F). As for myeloid cells (including MCs and DCs), we identified six transcriptionally distinct subsets: CD14 high CD16 -classical monocytes (CD14-MCs), CD14 high CD16 -PPBP high classical monocytes (CD14-MC-PPBP), CD14 +/ -CD16 high nonclassical monocytes\n\n(CD16-MCs), CD14 + CD16 +/ -intermediate monocytes (Intermed-MCs) (fig. S1, G and H), CD1c + conventional DCs (cDCs), and CLEC4C + plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) (fig. S1, G and H). These subtypes of cells were then used for downstream analyses."

            "subtitle": "## Cell type proportion-based clock models reveal SCs to be much younger than their actual age",
            "content": "With increased age, various cell types change in proportions (Fig. 2A). We therefore tested using cell type proportions of the scRNA-seq data to build a ' clock ' to predict age. We first trained a partial least square regression (PLSR) linear model and used leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) to assess the accuracy of the model. To compare prediction power across models and to prevent overfitting, all PLSR models in this study included only the top three components. We then calculated variable importance in projection (VIP) to rank the overall contribution of each variable to the PLSR model, and the variables with VIP score &gt; 1 are considered to be high explanatory variables ( 25 ). These include NKGZMH, CD8-CTL, CD8-Naive, CD4-Tm, CD4-Naive, Naive-B, NK-FCER1G, CD14-MC, and Memory-B-CRIP1 contributing significantly to the PLSR model (Fig. 2B). To extend the age spectrum of training data, using TOSICA ( 26 ), we further mapped the cell types of a published PBMC dataset generated by Guangdong Medical University that contains very old (72 to 100 years) samples (GM) ( 22 ) (fig. S2A) and trained a PLSR model. Although the GM dataset contains frail and old control samples, frail samples were reported to have elevated expression of the NEAT1 long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in a fraction of CD14 monocytes ( 22 ), which are not a cell type contributing to our cell type composition -based aging clocks, and we do not find that they differ significantly in cell type compositions (fig. S2B) or in scRNA-seq clock-predicted cAgeDiff (fig. S2C); therefore, we include both set of samples as expanded training samples. On the basis of this extended dataset (SE + GM), we find that the three-component PLSR model based on only the top 7 cell types generates a model with PCC between predicted and chronological age of 0.88 and MAD of 8.36 (Fig. 2C). Through saturation analysis, we find that the 28 reference samples we used for clock building are sufficient to reach a stable high accuracy (fig. S2D). We also used the cell type proportions to train an elastic net (EN) regression linear model and used the weight to rank the overall contribution of each variable to the EN model (fig. S2E). The EN model based on the top 7 cell types had a similarly accurate predictive power than PLSR model, with PCC and MADof0.89 and 7.86, respectively, between predicted and chronological age in SE + GM cohorts (fig. S2F), whereas the accuracy of PLSR model is more similar between training and independent cohorts, suggestive of a slightly better generalizability. Five of the top 7 cell types overlap between PLSR and EN model (fig. S2G), hinting at their critical importance at age prediction by blood cell type compositions.\n\nTo further validate our models, we tested them on blood scRNAseq data of three independent healthy cohorts, five CYCT individuals with an age range from 29 to 58 years old, five WHCT individuals from 37 to 71 years, and five JOCT individuals with an age range from 50s to 80s (age accurate to decades instead of years; thus, an error exceeding 5 years is expected by definition). Our seven-cell type PLSR model had MAD of 10.06, 10.91, and 10.16 and PCC of 0.43, 0.69, and 0.28 to chronological agein these three cohorts, respectively (fig. S2H). Similar MADs were found with the\n\nseven -cell type EN model (fig. S2I). When plotting the difference between predicted and chronological age (AgeDiff), we noticed that there is a slight systemic underprediction (negative AgeDiff) in old age and an overprediction (positive AgeDiff) in young age in our PLSR and EN models just as in other clock models ( 8 ); thus, we further corrected this systemic bias using Loess model to derive age-corrected AgeDiff (cAgeDiff) as described previously ( 8 )\n\nyounger than the youngest training sample, TOSICA-mapped umbilical cord blood samples (Cord) are predicted by our clock model to be -10.10 to -5.42 years old (Fig. 2D). Toward the other end of the age spectrum, SCs who are 20 years older than the oldest training sample are predicted to be 80.43 to 102.67 years old, on average 18.64 years younger than their chronological age. The age-corrected cell type EN model placed all SCs to below 110, as young as the average of 95.23 years old, and umbilical cord blood (Cord) to 7.12 to 12.68 years old (fig. S3B). We further confirmed that the age-corrected clock was not affected by batch-related factors, such as sex, datasets, and cell numbers (fig. S3, C to E).\n\nTo further test clock performance, we applied our age clocks to other independent disease datasets including a COVID-19 dataset and a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) dataset (fig. S2A). Our cell type composition -based PLSR model reveals a higher average biological age of individuals in disease states than age-matched controls as shown by cAgeDiff, which increases with the disease severity (Fig. 2, E to G). Perhaps due to the small sample size, only severe symptom COVID-19 patients are significantly older (Fig. 2E; t test, P = 0.040) and SLE symptoms managed and flare patients are highly significantly older than controls (Fig. 2G; t test, P = 8.77 \u00d7 10 -4 and 4.20 \u00d7 10 -3 ). cAgeDiff predicted by the EN models shows a consistent significant increase in diseases versus controls (fig. S3, F to H). These suggest that both the PLSR and EN cell type composition clock models can identify the increase in immune-related biological age of patients with these diseases.\n\nConsistent with the model-predicted ' slow aging ' of the SCs (Fig. 2D and fig. S2H), among the seven cell types used in the PLSR and those in EN models, a total of nine cell types (fig. S2G), a highly significant negative correlation exists between two CD8 + T subtypes, CD8 + CTL and CD8 + naive T cells, which significantly increase and decrease with age, respectively, in both SE + GM and SC cohorts, but SCs largely overlap with the 70- to 100-year-old SE + GMs (Fig. 2H). This suggests that the polarization of CD8 + naive T toward CD8 + CTL is an aging hallmark at the blood cell population level."

            "subtitle": "## Age-related cell composition changes are delayed in SCs",
            "content": "Now that we have natural aging cohort-derived clock models, instead of artificially using any particular age group as controls, we use the cellular and molecular deviation of model-predicted versus their actual status in SCs to decipher features associated with their extreme longevity (Fig. 3A). We reverse-calculated the cell type compositions at age 110 years by PLSR clock models (Materials and Methods). Alternatively, based on the top 7 cell types in the PLSR and EN clock models (Fig. 2E), we defined the cell types whose proportions are significantly positively or negatively correlated with age by linear regression model (LR) (with RCC to age slope, P &lt; 0.05), without age-related systemic bias (fig. S4A). Then, the expected cell proportions at age 110 are calculated based on the PLSR model or the LR model, and if they are significantly higher or lower than the real proportions in SCs ( z score, P &lt; 0.05), the cell types are considered as ' SC delayed age-up cell types ' or ' SC delayed agedown cell types ' (Fig. 3A). We find that SCs show significantly delayed age-dependent decrease in CD8 + naive T cells, Naive B cells, Memory-B, and NK-GZMK ( z score, P &lt; 0.05), marginally significantly delayed age-dependent increase in CD4 + Tm( z score, P &lt; 0.1) compared to the PLSR model (fig. S4B), and delayed age-dependent decrease in CD8 + naive T cells and delayed age-dependent increase in CD4 + Tm and Naive B compared to the LR model (fig. S4C). In addition, the frequencies of cell types that contribute to the aging clocks and are delayed in SCs show no differences between the predicted values and real values of individuals from both training and independent cohorts, except in Cord and SC cohorts (fig. S4, D and E). When the proportions of age down-regulated CD8Naive cells and age up-regulated CD4 Tm cells are plotted across age, there are clear delayed deviations of SCs from the linear trend line over the 28 samples of 28 to 100 years (fig. S4F)."

            "subtitle": "## Age-related single-cell gene expression changes are delayed in SCs",
            "content": "We used the sum of gene expressions of all cells belonging to each individual to train PLSR models as pseudo-bulk transcriptome clock model, which predicts the 28 training samples at MAD of 5.04 and PCC of 0.97 to chronological age (Fig. 3B) and predicts SCs to a mean age of 82.49 years (fig. S4G). We used the sum of gene expressions of all cells belonging to each cell type for each individual to train PLSR models as the pseudo-bulk transcriptome clock for the cell type separately with MAD from 4.80 (ABC) to 9.60 (Plasma) years (Fig. 3C). These clocks, more dramatically than the cell type proportion-based clocks, predicted the SC median transcriptome ages to 51.62 to 63.19 years before age correction (fig. S4H) to 65.01 to 75.83 after age correction (Fig. 3C). Then, based on these PLSR clock models, or alternatively defining top contributing genes with VIP &gt; 1 (table S1) as age-related, and predicted their expression levels at 110 using LR models in each cell type, we then defined ' SC delayed age-up genes ' (up-regulated with age and delayed in SCs) and ' SC delayed age-down genes ' (downregulated with age and delayed in SCs) similar to cell type analysis described above (Fig. 3A). Using the LR models, which show no systematic bias against age (fig. S5, A and B, and table S2), we find 2749 and 495 age-up and age-down genes, respectively (table S3), and 1023 age-up and 149 age-down genes significantly delayed in SCs. As validation of the model, we find no significant differences between real and predicted gene expressions of genes that contribute to the aging clocks and are delayed in SCs in the training cohort, as well as in other independent cohorts, except in SC cohorts (fig. S5C). Transcription factor (TF) target enrichment analysis shows that age-up and age-down genes are enriched for targets of FOXR2, ZNF318, PSMB5, PER1, ZZZ3, and NERF (fig. S5, D and F). Among them, FOXR2, ZNF318, PSMB5, and ZZZ3 targets are enriched in SC delayed age-down genes and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF\u03baB) targets are enriched in SC delayed age-up genes (fig. S5, F and G). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses reveal that age-up genes enrich for NF\u03baB/ tumor necrosis factor (TNF)/TLR/NOD/FoxO signaling pathway, virus infection, apoptosis, T cell receptor signaling pathway, cytokine, and PD-1 pathway (fig. S6, A and B), and among them, NF\u03baB/TNF/TLR/NOD/FoxO signaling pathway, virus infection, apoptosis, cytokine, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway are significantly delayed in SCs (Fig. 3D), while age-down genes most commonly enrich for ribosome genes (fig. S6, C and D), which are significantly delayed in most cell types of SCs (Fig. 3E and table S4).\n\nCompared to the PLSR model -expected values, there are 111 age-up genes significantly delayed in the SCs, which are related to MAPK signaling pathway, rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, NF\u03baB signaling pathway, and virus infection (fig. S6E), whereas\n\n1261 age-down genes are significantly delayed in SCs. Again, ribosome- and translation-related genes are enriched in most cell types at the very top of the list (fig. S6F). The delay of these ribosome genes decline in SCs cannot be attributed to batch effect in gene expression because, as a group, average ribosome gene expressions in each cell type do not differ among different cohorts [analysis of variance (ANOVA), P = 0.53; fig. S7A], while the age down-regulated ribosome genes identified in SEs also decrease with age in other cohorts (fig. S7B)."

            "content": "On the basis of the above results, we wondered whether age-related decline in ribosome levels and age-related increase of inflammation levels are two linked events of the single-cell aging. To quantitatively assess the inflammatory state of each cell, we calculated the inflammatory score for each cell based on inflammatory-related gene list (table S5) as described previously ( 29 ). The median expression levels of ribosome genes are used to indicate the level of ribosomes in each cell. In both SE and SC cohort, there is a significant negative correlation (PCC = -0.22, P &lt; 2.2 \u00d7 10 -16 in SE, PCC = -0.23, P &lt; 2.2 \u00d7 10 -16 in SC, PCC = -0.30, P &lt; 2.2 \u00d7 10 -16 combined) between ribosome level and inflammation score across all single cells of all cell types (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, across different cell types, there is also a significant negative correlation between the average ribosome levels and average inflammation scores (RCC = -0.58, P = 0.0021 in SE, RCC = -0.59, P = 0.0020 in SC, RCC = -0.58, P = 1.0 \u00d7 10 -5 combined) (Fig. 4B). On the basis of this ribosome level versus inflammation score distribution, cell types can be separated into highinflammatory and low-ribosome (HI-LR) cell types, which include Intermed-MC, CD14-MC, CD16-MC, CD14-MC-PPBP, and megakaryocytes, and low-inflammatory and high-ribosome (LIHR) cell types, which are the rest of the cell types (Fig. 4B). In all but one cell type, the total ribosome gene expression level decreases with age in SEs, whereas in HI-LR cell types, SCs show a similar level to young SEs (Fig. 4C). Consistently, principal components analysis (PCA) analysis based on ribosomal and inflammatory gene expressions in each single cell within the same cell type shows that for most cell types, for example, CD4-Treg and CD14-MC, single cells fall into two major cellular states, corresponding to high and low ribosome expression, respectively (fig. S8A). Consistent with the ribosome expression level, the proportion of cells in the high ribosome state decreases with age for most cell types (RCC to age range from -0.64 to 0.43 with a median of -0.23; Fig. 4D and table S6).\n\nRemarkably, SCs consistently have more cells in the high ribosome state than SE in the HI-LR cell types (Fig. 4D). These indicate that HI-LR cell types ' high ribosome expression, or more precisely more cells in high ribosome state, is a common feature of super longevity at the single-cell level in the blood.\n\nWe also validated the changes of ribosome expression and inflammation scores in COVID-19 and SLE cohorts. Consistent with the balance between ribosome expression and inflammation, with the disease progression in COVID-19 and SLE, the inflammatory score consistently increased and the expression level of ribosomes decreased in all cell types and HI-LR cells, with the changes generally more pronounced in SLE than in COVID-19 (fig. S9).\n\nFurthermore, we find significantly different cell-cell communication between cells in the high ribosome versus in the low ribosome within most cell types (Fig. 4E). In the low-ribosome state, the top 100 ligand-receptor pairs are mostly between CD8-CTL and the rest of the cell types, including MHCII, S100A8/A9TLR4, CCL5-CCR5, and TNF-related pairs, while these are all significantly lower in high-ribosome state ( t test, P &lt; 0.01; Fig. 4E and fig. S8B). The most commonly down-regulated ligand-receptor pair in high versus low ribosome state is the interaction between ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19) and its membrane receptor C5AR1 (fig. S8B), which has been reported to suppress immune response ( 30 ).\n\nFinally, to understand the causal relationships among ribosome level, inflammation level, age, and aging rate in SE + GM data, we inferred a Bayesian network (BN) based on all single cells in HI-LR and LI-HR cell types, respectively, in the aging rate reference SE + GM data. Here, aging rate is measured by age-corrected AgeDiff, which is the difference between the predicted age and the chronological age based on the cell composition PLSR model and corrected by age. The BN model infers that AgeDiff is dependent on the level of ribosome and inflammation in the HI-LR cell types, and the level of ribosome is in turn dependent on age. The model also infers that a decrease in ribosome level increases in the level of inflammation in the HI-LR cells. This is not the case in LI-HR cell types, where age decreases inflammation score, and inflammation score does not contribute to aging rate (Fig. 4F). These suggest that ribosome abundance, which is often a surrogate of translation and growth rate, may suppress the inflammatory cytokine secretion of the HILRcells; in other words, high level of inflammatory cytokine expression might be a consequence of stagnant growth or insufficient basally low ribosomal activities of the HI-LR cell types, and that SCs might benefit from the high cellular ribosome/translation/ growth rate to counteract aging-induced chronic inflammation. In contrast, rather than inducing an inflammatory state, the basally low-level inflammatory cytokines might be a consequence of the normal growth of the LI-HR cells (Fig. 4F). Similar relationships can be consistently observed in BN models inferred for each cell type, and based on the interactions in these BNs, the HI-LR cell types automatically aggregate together and segregate from other cell types by unsupervised hierarchical clustering (Fig. 4G).\n\nFinally, to confirm the inferred suppression of inflammation by ribosomal activity (translation) in HI-LR cells, we temporally inhibited translation using a translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX), which binds to the 60 S ribosomal unit and inhibits translation elongation ( 31 ), in human blood primary monocyte cells and THP-1 monocyte cell line, which represents a HI-LR cell type and was\n\nfound to secrete senescence-associated cytokines in our previous study ( 32 ). As expected from the BN model, inhibiting translation caused a significant up-regulation of commonly observed inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8, in a time-dependent manner in primary monocyte cells (Fig. 4H) and THP-1 (fig. S8C)."
