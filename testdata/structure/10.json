However, these have been invariably based on static datasets from which fate trajectories can only be inferred using pseudotemporal estimations. Furthermore, the analysis of isolated islets has resulted in a drastic underrepresentation of other cell types, hindering our ability to interrogate exocrine-endocrine interactions. The long-term culture of human pancreatic slices (HPSs) has presented the field with an opportunity to dynamically track tissue plasticity at the single-cell level. Combining datasets from same-donor HPSs at different time points, with or without a known regenerative stimulus (BMP signaling), led to integrated single-cell datasets storing true temporal or treatment-dependent information. This integration revealed population shifts consistent with ductal progenitor activation, blurring of ductal/acinar boundaries, formation of ductoacinar-endocrine differentiation axes, and detection of transitional insulin-producing cells. This study provides the first longitudinal scRNA-seq analysis of whole human pancreatic tissue, confirming its plasticity in a dynamic fashion.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nAdvances in single-cell transcriptomics have changed the traditional view that cell fates are static, uncovering instead a palette of differentiation stages. This is particularly true of the pancreas, 1-13 whose plasticity under stress has also been confirmed in multiple settings. 10,14-22 However, the potential of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to resolve regeneration events in the human pancreas at the single-cell level has not been fully unleashed. 23,24 While cell fate dynamism may be implicit from some observations, all studies to date have been limited to transcriptomic snapshots that only reflect the cellular makeup of the sample at the time of collection. Bioinformatics can be used to infer fate trajectories from static data applying pseudotemporal analyses. 25-27 Sometimes, these predictions can be confirmed experimentally, but only to a certain extent. 10\n\nas possible a model of the human pancreas that retains the overall cytoarchitecture, cell niches, and intercompartmental interactions of the native organ. Shuttled aboard adenoviral vehicles, a multicolor reporter and an insulin lineage tracer have already been used to track b cell formation in real time. 29 Important as these results are, they just offer a taste of the possibilities afforded by the extended culture of HPSs to dynamically dissect pancreatic plasticity.\n\nBone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling has been associated with regeneration in multiple organs. 30-33 We have described progenitor-like ductal cells characterized by their responsiveness to BMP-7, a transforming growth factor (TGF)b family member. 10,21,24,29 BMP-7 stimulation of the BMP receptor 1A (BMPR1A, also known as activin-like receptor-3 or ALK3) induces the proliferation of these cells, whereas the withdrawal of this factor is permissive for their differentiation along ductal, acinar, and endocrine lineages both in vitro 21 and after transplantation. 10 scRNA-seq analysis of sorted human pancreatic ductal cells reveals progenitor-like clusters whose\n\ntranscriptomic stemness suggests a role for stress-mediated de-differentiation. 10,22 Importantly, cell trajectory analyses following integration of this ductal dataset with other published datasets that also include endocrine and acinar cells 2,34 suggested ducto-acinar and ducto-endocrine differentiation axes. However, these conclusions were qualified by the fact that they came from the amalgamation of multiple datasets from many donors, processed/analyzed in different ways, and also in the absence of a defined regenerative stimulus whose effect could be investigated in a truly serial manner.\n\nWe hypothesized that the sequential scRNA-seq of samedonor HPSs would circumvent these constraints, allowing us to dissect fate changes at the single-cell level in response to BMP-7 in a ''whole-pancreas'' setting. To test this hypothesis, we conducted the longitudinal scRNA-seq analysis of HPSs subjected to 5 days of BMP-7 exposure followed by 5 days without. The most immediate observation was the transcriptomic heterogeneity of the ductal and acinar compartments, which most earlier analyses (based on isolated islet samples with a small proportion of ductal and acinar cells) had failed to detect. With the exception of a recent single-nucleus RNA-seq report, 11 no other study thus far has presented the field with a true whole-pancreas analysis where the different cell types of the organ retain their natural proportion. Integration of single-cell datasets obtained from same-donor HPSs at different time points, and in the presence or absence of treatment, allowed us to conduct trajectory calculations based on true temporal information, rather than by pseudotemporal inferences. This integration revealed population shifts consistent with BMP-7-mediated progenitor activation, the blurring of ductal/ acinar boundaries, the formation of clear ducto-acinar-endocrine differentiation axes, and, notably, the appearance of transitional insulin-producing cell populations.\n\nIn summary, our study provides the first longitudinal scRNAseq analysis of whole human pancreatic tissue, mapping true cell fate trajectories in a manner that was simply not possible prior to the development of long-term HPS culture techniques. These experiments unequivocally confirm pancreatic plasticity in a dynamic fashion and validate the reliability of this novel human-based model.\n",

            "content": "Single-cell libraries were sequenced, aligned to the human reference genome, filtered for quality control, and subjected to unsupervised clustering, integration, and differential gene expression analysis using Seurat v4.1.1 (STAR Methods). A uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) plot of the three pooled preparations for untreated (control) slices at time point 1 (5 days of culture) was generated. The differential expression of genes of any given cluster vs. all other clusters in a single dataset was used to identify representative markers. We also performed studies where the differential expression of specific clusters was compared between datasets. We refer to the former as ''cluster marker analysis'' and to the latter, simply, as differential expression.\n\nCluster analysis revealed two major domains, corresponding to ductal (D) and acinar (A) cells (UMAP, heatmap and select feature plots in Figures 1A-1C). Out of 53,950 cells analyzed, 35,857 were acinar (A,66.46%), 17,051 ductal (D,31.6%), 161 endocrine (I, 0.29%), 358 macrophages (M, 0.66%), 114 endothelial (E, 0.21%), and 409 stellate (S, 0.76%). Overall, this amounts to 98% of exocrine and 2% of other cell types. Despite a slight underrepresentation of islets, these relative proportions are aligned with those historically reported for the organ. 35,36\n\nD1 ( SPP1 + ) and D2 ( TFF1 / 2 + ) correspond to the two ductal clusters previously identified as harboring progenitor-like cells. 10 The top marker in D1 is secreted phosphoprotein 1 ( SPP1 ) (Data S2, control time point 1 or CTP1). SPP1 marks pancreatic precursors 37 and proliferative ducts 38 in mice. Inhibition of differentiation (ID)1 and 4 genes are also elevated, as in murine 39,40 and human P2RY1 + /ALK3 bright+ progenitors. 21 This is also the case for HES1 , another inhibitor of differentiation. 41 Inflammation/ stress responses 10 are prevalent in marker and gene ontology (GO) analyses of D1 (Data S2, CTP1). This progenitor-like signature is consistent with stress-mediated de-differentiation within the ductal tree. 10,21,22,42,43\n\nD2 features trefoil factors 1 ( TFF1 ) and 2 ( TFF2 ) among the top markers (Data S2, CTP1). These proteins orchestrate cell\n\nCells with a proliferative profile are found in D4, represented by stathmin 1 ( STMN1 ), a cell-cycle regulator 50 (Data S2, CTP1). The Human Protein Atlas shows STMN1 staining in terminal ducts (Figure S1B), similar to the high mobility group B family-2 (HMGB2) protein, another marker associated to proliferation. 51 Other division-related markers are proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) 52 and helicase lymphoid specific ( HELLS ). 53 GO pathway confirms the proliferative nature of these cells (Data S2, CTP1).\n\nCluster D5 ( MUC6 + ) identifies a small population of functional ductal cells. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) is among the top cluster markers (Figure S1B; Data S2, CTP1).\n\nA1 ( CPB1 + / CUZD1 + ) is the acinar cluster in closest proximity to the ductal domain. Interestingly, it is the only acinar cluster with meaningful expression of the ductal genes CFTR , SPP1 , and cytokeratin 19 ( KRT19 ) (Figure S1A; Data S2, CTP1). Glycoprotein 2 ( GP2 ), 54,55 a marker of progenitor-like de-differentiated acinar cells, 17 is also highly expressed.\n\nNo secreted proteins appear among the markers for A2 ( NEAT-1 + ) (Figures 1A and 1C; Data S2, CTP1). The top one is NEAT-1 , which produces a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) essential to form paraspeckles, ribonucleoprotein bodies linked to cell metabolism changes, 56 and stress-mediated proliferation. 57\n\nClusters A3-A6 are secretory (Data S2, CTP1). A3 has elevated ANKRD36C + and RNASE1 + as well as several enzymes involved in glutathione metabolism. A4 ( MT1G + ) cells appear morespecialized in metal transport (e.g., copper/zinc homeostasis 58 ), whereas A5 ( CLPS + ) and A6 ( CELA3B + ) exhibit general secretory features.\n\nAdditionally, our analysis identified clusters rich in stellate cells (S, COL1A1 + ), endothelial cells (E, PECAM1 + ), islet/endocrine cells (I, INS + ), and macrophages (M, CCL3 + ) (Figures 1A and 1C; Data S2, CTP1). The presence of the latter is consistent with our earlier findings that islets within HPSs contain macrophages that secrete homeostatic factors in a purinergic-dependent manner. 59"

            "content": "HPSs cultured for an additional 5 days (10 days in total: time point 2) were analyzed as above (Figure 1D). Cell composition was similar to that at time point 1, with 30,489 acinar (63.33%), 16,117 ductal (33.48%), 221 endocrine (0.46%), 346 macro-\n\nphages (0.71%), 181 endothelial (0.37%), and 784 stellate cells (1.62%). While there was a slight cell number reduction (48,138 at time point 2 vs. 53,950 at time point 1), it was not statistically significant (p = 0.204), and the relative percentages of exocrine (96.8%) and non-exocrine (3.2%) cells were essentially maintained. When examining these figures by cell type, however, there was a statistically significant increase in stellate cells (0.76%-1.62%, p = 0.0046) from days 5 to 10. This may be due to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), 60 which, even if less widespread than in other culture settings, 61 may also occur in slices over time.\n\nCluster identity was maintained with only minor changes (Figure S2; Data S2, CTP2). The ductal domain still featured clusters D1-D4, but not D5. There was a significant cell number increase in D3 (p = 0.0015) (Figures S3A and S3B). A1-A4 remained unchanged, but A5 (secretory, CLPS + ) was no longer an independent cluster. In contrast, two new acinar clusters appeared: A7 and A8, both related to A4. Differential expression analysis between the two control time points (Data S2, DE CTP1 + CTP2) shows that some acinar clusters had somewhat lower expression of secretory markers at the 10-day mark, but ductal and endocrine markers were largely unaffected. The new cluster distribution amounts to a minor reshuffling of the cells between those described for time point 1, without any discernible new phenotypes. This observation further supports the strength of the HPS model for the dynamic interrogation of pancreatic plasticity at the single-cell level."

            "subtitle": "## BMP-7 treatment results in ducto-acinar hybrid cell formation",
            "content": "To study the net effect of BMP-7, we first compared BMP-7treated samples (Figure 2A, left) with their untreated control at time point 1 (Figure 1A). While cell number was higher in the BMP-7 group (61,875 vs. 53,950), the difference was not significant (p = 0.291). This observation also held true when analyzing ductal (p = 0.086), acinar (p = 0.424), and islet cell (p = 0.314) counts. Nevertheless, the UMAP of BMP-7-treated samples (Figure 2A, left) is markedly different to that of untreated slices at the same stage (Figure 1A) owing to the appearance of a new cluster (D6) that bridges the ductal and acinar domains (Figure 2A, red arrow). Several D6 markers overlap with those of D1 ( SPP1 + ) (Data S3, BMP-7 time point 1 or BTP1). However, D6 cells appear to have a hybrid ducto-acinar phenotype, as most markers differentially expressed in comparison with D1 are acinar (Figure S4; Data S3, BTP1). Another D6 marker is OLFM4 , previously described as a stem cell marker in the human intestine. 62\n\nNotably, D6 is no longer an independent cluster in the UMAP analysis of BMP-7-treated slices at time point 2 (Figure 2A, right). Aside from a very small ductal cluster featuring interferon response/apoptosis markers (D7, ISG-15 + ) and the disappearance of the proliferative cluster D4, the overall distribution of this group is similar to that of untreated samples at either stage, with comparable cluster identities and somewhat disconnected acinar and ductal domains (Figure S4 and Data S3, BMP-7 time point 2 or BTP2). Together, these observations provide evidence for a response to BMP-7 manifested as a transient hybrid cluster that bridges the ductal and acinar regions.\n\n(C) A three-dimensional UMAP (left chart) reveals that D6 not only bridges the ductal and acinar domains but also resides at the core of the acinar clusters A2.1 (brown) and A4 (green). To unveil these spatial relationships, cluster A2.1 is eliminated first from the 3D UMAP (center chart), and then the same is done for cluster A4 (right chart). A magnified region of the exposed cells (far right) shows the transcriptomic continuity of D6 (teal) with A1 (beige). See also Data S1, S3, S4, and S5.\n\nmay be identified with different genes (e.g., A1 may feature CPB1 , OLFM4 , or ALDH1A1 depending on their relative stagewise expression).\n\nAll major ductal clusters are well preserved, including D6. This bridge cluster is now in proximity to A1, which we characterized as the most ductal within the acinar domain. Three-dimensional UMAPs, which we first developed in Qadir et al., 10 reveal nuanced spatial relationships between clusters that are not immediately apparent\n\nThe availability of scRNA-seq datasets of the same tissue (i.e., HPSs from the same donor) with and without treatment allows for the examination of cell evolution with a degree of accuracy not afforded by snapshot-type cell trajectory analyses, where discrete scRNA-seq datasets are used to make fate inferences. Applying trajectory algorithms on integrated datasets (e.g., control + BMP-7) would ''connect the dots'' instead, yielding a true map of cellular fate decisions in response to BMP-7 treatment. The combined UMAP of untreated and BMP-7-treated datasets is shown in Figure 2B (see also Data S4, control + BTP1 or CBTP1). Of note, to maintain numbering consistency across datasets, a slightly different cluster notation is introduced when a new cluster is closely related to an existing one. For instance, an A2 variation is termed A2.1 ( PTGR1 + ), since A3 is maintained across other datasets but is not an independent cluster here. Also, while some clusters retain their number/notation, they in 2D representations. In this case, a 3D UMAP (Figures 2C and S3C, supplemental plot 1) shows that the transcriptomic overlap between D6 and A1 is much more evident than in its 2D counterpart. A1 is in fact at the core of multiple other clusters (A2, A2.1, and A4) that need to be ''peeled off'' in order to expose it (Figure 2C). The D6-A1 continuity (Figure 2C, right) strongly supports the notion that BMP-7 induces a ducto-acinar transcriptomic gradient.\n\nExamining the relative contribution of untreated and BMP-7treated cells to cluster D6 of the integrated dataset (differential expression), we discovered that OLFM4 is downregulated only in the latter, along with elevated ID3 expression (Data S5, control vs. BTP1 or CvsBTP1). This is specific for D6, as the opposite is true of every other cluster (Figure S3D). This observation is aligned with earlier reports that ID3 (a BMP signaling target 63,64 ) inhibits OLFM4 in the intestinal epithelium 65-67 and BMP-7treated pancreatic progenitors. 21\n\nAnother interesting feature of D6 is that 69 genes that are upregulated in BMP-7-treated vs. control slices have an opposite expression profile in the other clusters. ID3 , and to a lesser\n\ndegree ID1 and ID2 , are among the most upregulated genes in D6, but they are downregulated in the rest of the clusters. Other such genes were JUND , a positive regulator of the b cell progenitor marker SOX4 68,69 ; KRT8 , highly expressed in progenitor clusters 70 ; and four genes related to cell motility/migration, the non-muscle ACTN4 , MYH9 , ITGB1 , and MARCKS .\n\nThe appearance of a new ductal cluster at the tip of the acinar domain (DX, S100A10 + ) is also noteworthy. DX is related to D3 (duct gland morphogenetic), judging from the expression of multiple common markers (e.g., S100A6 , ANXA2 , and TFPI2 ) and GOpathways such as cell migration and epithelial cell differentiation (Data S4, CBTP1). Next to DX, there is a group of cells identified as endocrine ( INS + ). This observation was intriguing because there is another well-defined cluster with the same identity outside the two main ductal and acinar domains. We termed the latter ''island 1'' and the former ''island 2.'' Although these are distant in the 2D UMAP, the 3D plot indicates that they are actually in apposition (Figures S3E, S3F, and S3C, supplemental plot 2).\n\nWe next performed RNA velocity (Velocyto) analysis on the integrated dataset. This cell trajectory tool is based on mRNA splicing kinetics. By distinguishing unspliced from spliced, the change of mRNA abundance (RNA velocity) can be approximated. 27 The combination of velocities across mRNAs predicts the future state of an individual cell. As indicated earlier, the accuracy of such prediction would benefit from the integration of two datasets corresponding to a treatment (BMP-7) and its internal control at the same time point. Figure 3A depicts the RNA velocity chart of the above by scVelo, a tool designed to disentangle lineage decisions using a likelihood-based model. 71 As arrows generally represent local cell state/fate direction, cells from D1 ( SPP1 + ) and D2 ( TFF1 / 2 + ) are projected to become chiefly other ductal cell types. The BMP-7-dependent D6 cluster acts as a node with a direct connection to A1, suggesting an active ducto-acinar transition, as previously anticipated. 10 There are distinct cell state trajectories within the acinar domain consistent with a gradient from low to high secretory activity, supporting the idea that the acinar compartment is functionally plastic. Partition-based graph abstractions (PAGAs) of RNA velocity 72 provide a visually logical representation of the above paths (Figure 3B), further revealing yet another set of connections along the D2-D3-DX/endocrine island 2 axis. All these connections reveal a ductal-to-acinar direction.\n\nTo further dissect the two subclusters of INS + cells that appear upon integration of untreated and BMP-7-treated datasets, we extracted those cells for additional clustering analysis (Figure 3B, bottom). Feature plots with representative marker expression profiles are shown in Figure 3C. A detailed UMAP (Figure 3B) re- veals three clusters. Cluster 3 is the most differentiated/mature and is composed almost entirely of cells from island 1. Its top markers are INS and chromogranin A ( CHGA ), consistent with a mature b cell phenotype (Figure 3C and Data S6, endocrine control + BTP1 or E-CBTP1). This cluster, made up of similar amounts of cells from untreated and treated groups, likely represents pre-existing islets, unaffected by BMP-7. In contrast, clusters 1 and 2 (mostly composed of island 2 cells) exhibit an immature/hybrid phenotype (Figures S5A-S5C). Cluster 1 expresses acinar ( CPB1, PRSS1, CLPS , etc.) and ductal ( KRT7 and KRT18 ) markers simultaneously. Cluster 2 also exhibits a blend of acinar ( CEL , CELA3A , GPX2 , etc.) and ductal ( KRT19 , KRT18 , STMN1 , etc.) genes but also features the endocrine genes glucagon ( GCG ) and TMSB10 73 among the top markers (Data S6, E-CBTP1). Based on the degree of co-localization of endocrine with ductal/acinar markers, cluster 2 exhibits an intermediate degree of ''purity'' (i.e., the relative percentage of insulin + or glucagon + cells that do not express also CEL [acinar] or KRT18 [ductal]) between clusters 1 and 3 (Figures 3E, S5B, and S5C). These intermediate cells are also more acinar-like than those of the other two clusters (yellow portion of pie chart, Figure 3E and Data S6, E-CBTP1). Notably, whereas the cells that make up cluster 1 originate from both untreated and BMP7-treated samples, those of cluster 2 are almost completely derived from the BMP-7 group (Figures 3D and 3E). These findings strongly suggest that BMP-7 stimulates the conversion of ductal into endocrine cell types through a transitional acinarlike stage. Pseudotime (Figure 3F), as well as scVelo (Figure 3G) and PAGA (Figure 3H) trajectory calculations confirm the direction of this transition. Interestingly, a stagewise marker co-localization analysis (Figure 3I) suggests that BMP-7 reduces the overall purity of the islet clusters at time point 1 compared with controls, due to a relative acinarization. This may be a reflection of a BMP-mediated increase in cells that are halfway through the ducto-acinar-endocrine differentiation axis (i.e., cells that have transitioned from ductal to acinar-like and are starting to express endocrine genes). The net increase in endocrine cells from control (178) to BMP-7-treated (229) groups is consistent with the notion that BMP-7-induced transitional/acinarized endocrine cells are diluting the degree of cluster purity imparted by the pre-existing mature ones. However, this difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.314), probably due to donor variability.\n\nTogether, our data show that BMP-7 induces: (1) the activation of ductal progenitors that acquire a ducto-acinar phenotype, not detected in control samples, and (2) the formation of a second differentiation axis that ultimately yields ducto-acinar-endocrine transitional events, identified here for the first time at the singlecell level."

            "content": "We have previously established that BMP-7 induces the mobilization of ductal progenitors, and that its removal is conducive to their differentiation into all the epithelial lineages of the pancreas. 10,21,24,29,61 This study has already confirmed BMP7-mediated progenitor activation and the initiation of a ductoacinar-endocrine differentiation axis. To study the effect of BMP-7 removal in the same biological samples that received the treatment (i.e., same-donor serial slices), we integrated the datasets corresponding to the BMP-7 group at time point 1 (5 days of treatment) and time point 2 (5 additional days). The resulting UMAP is shown in Figures 4A and S3C, supplemental plot 3 (3D rendering), and the marker analysis in Data S4, BTP1 + 2). Compared with the previous combination of untreated + BMP-7treated HPSs at time point 1, the ''bridge'' progenitor cluster D6 is no longer detected, but several observations indicate that it may have evolved into cluster A3.1 ( MUC1 + ): First, as evidenced in the 3D UMAP, this is the only acinar cluster whose cells are also dispersed across the ductal domain (Figures S3C, supplemental plot 3 and S3G, left). Second, as D6, A3.1 also displays ducto-acinar hybrid characteristics (Figure S3H). GO analysis indicates that epithelial cell development/differentiation are among the most upregulated pathways (Data S4, BTP1 + 2). This suggests that some of the cells that made up D6 may be further advanced in the ducto-acinar-endocrine differentiation arch (hence the disappearance of the bridge). Fittingly, one of the top markers of A3.1 is RETREG1 . This gene is critically involved in autophagy, an integral process in stem cell differentiation and postmitotic tissue remodeling. 74 Of note, while A1 (the ''landing site'' in the untreated + BMP-7 at time point 1 integrated dataset) appears to reside now at the far side of the acinar domain, the 3D UMAP exposes its spatial continuity with A3.1 (Figures S3C, supplemental plot 3 and S3G, right). scVelo (Figure 4B) and PAGA (Figure 4C) analyses further suggest that A3.1, unlike its putative predecessor D6, is no longer made of cells transitioning from ductal to acinar, but rather a new focal point for additional acinar and endocrine differentiation. While differentiation paths still show a ductal-to-acinar direction, PAGA unveils a new connection (not observed in the untreated + BMP-7 integration) between A3.1 and the I cluster ( INS + ) (Fig- ure 4C). This observation suggests the completion of the ducto-acinar-endocrine differentiation axis triggered by BMP-7. Clustering analysis of the endocrine cells (I) reveals two subclusters (Figures 4D and S5D and Data S6, endocrine BMP-7 time points 1 + 2 or E-BTP1 + 2). Marker profiles, as well as the co-localization degree of endocrine, acinar, and ductal genes (Figures 4E and S5E-S5H), indicate that cluster 2 is the most mature. The least differentiated cluster has a higher contribution from time point 1 cells, whereas time point 2 cells are proportionally more abundant in the most mature cluster (Figure 4E). Pseudotime (Figure 4F), scVelo (Figure 4G), and PAGA (Figure 4H) trajectory calculations unequivocally establish the direction of differentiation. Stagewise endocrine/acinar/ ductal marker co-localization analysis (Figure 4I), coupled with the differential expression between time points 1 and 2 (Data S5, BTP1 vs. 2) indicate that there is a time-dependent maturation of the cells that make up the endocrine cluster upon withdrawal of BMP-7, with a loss of acinar markers (yellow in pie chart) and a gain in purity (red) of the insulin-producing cell population.\n\nTogether, our results confirm the prediction that BMP signaling stimulates a ducto-acinar-endocrine differentiation arch in cultured HPSs, where ductal progenitor-like cells acquire first a hybrid ducto-acinar phenotype and, upon BMP-7 removal, complete their differentiation into other pancreatic tissues, including endocrine cells. Stagewise scRNA-seq of samples from the same donors cultured for 10 days allows for the precise characterization of each of these events at the single-cell level, as exemplified by the description of a novel BMP-7-dependent hybrid ducto-acinar cluster bridging the acinar and ductal domains (Figures 2A and 2B) or the appearance of ''transitional'' endocrine cells (Figure 3D)."

            "content": "A prediction of our scRNA-seq study is that BMP-7 will induce the formation of new insulin-expressing cells in HPSs. To experimentally validate it, and to determine whether such cells are functional, we set up a viral co-transduction strategy for the fluorescence-based tracing of insulin-producing cells. This strategy was designed so that the expression of Cre driven by a human insulin promoter (HIP) that faithfully recapitulates the native\n\ngene expression in HPSs 29 (tracer adenovirus) would elicit a recombination event in a second (reporter) adenovirus, resulting in the excision of a red cassette (dsRed) and the blue (monomeric ox-blue fluorescent protein [moxBFP]) tagging of the cell (Figure 5A). Through a 2A self-cleaving peptide, moxBFP tagging would also be accompanied by the expression of GcAMP6s (green), a sensitive fluorescent Ca 2+ indicator 75 that serves as an indirect measurement of glucose-dependent insulin secretion. To establish proof of principle, we first tested this reporter + HIP-Cre strategy on human isolated islets. As shown in Figure 5B, fibrinogen/thrombin-immobilized islet b cells were labeled in blue/green, with the intensity of the green signal increasing from 5 to 20 mM of glucose.\n\nThe HPS experimental approach is schematized in Figure 5C. The first samples tested were from a pediatric donor, a possible type 1 diabetes (T1D) case (6,528; STAR Methods, demographics). Within 96 h of transduction, insulin-expressing cells were labeled blue (moxBFP) and green (GcAMP6s) (Figure 5D). As previously determined, 29 pre-existing b cells were directly tagged with the insulin marker without undergoing an intermediate (red) stage. This is a key difference with neogenic insulin-producing cells, which are tagged red after transduction and only change color after the insulin promoter is activated following BMP-7 treatment. The visualization of this purple (red + blue) transition starting at day 7 ( /C24 2 days after BMP-7 withdrawal) (Figure 5E) is possible thanks to the long half-life ( /C24 4.6 days) of dsRed. 76 Figure 5F presents the quantification of red (left), blue (center), and blue:red (right) signal throughout 9 days of culture in control (untreated) and BMP-7-treated slices, confirming our earlier findings 29 in a likely T1D case. Untreated HPSs show a time-dependent increase in blue until day 4-5, corresponding to the labeling of co-transduced pre-existing b cells, which then plateaus. In contrast, signal keeps increasing with time in BMP-7-treated slices as neogenic insulin + cells appear after BMP-7 removal.\n\nUnlike the islets in Figure 5B, HPSs were not immobilized, and Ca 2+ measurements in individual moxBFP-labeled cells proved challenging. To overcome this problem, we adapted a Ca 2+ imaging system originally designed for islets (STAR Methods). Another issue was the difficulty to track specific cells over time. Slices are live tissues where cells move from day to day, andsometimes die and disappear. To address it, adenoviral concentration was titrated down 10 3 for all ensuing experiments, reducing the overall amount of signal over the multiple cell layers of the 120m m-thick slices, and thus ''cleaning'' the images. We applied these modifications to study HPSs from another pediatric donor, who was autoantibody-positive (CV-15; STAR Methods, demographics). Figure 5G (left) shows two cells that start expressing insulin around day 9 (4 days after BMP-7 withdrawal), as evidenced by the co-expression of red and blue (left). As predicted, they also express GcAMP6s (right). Ca 2+ imaging in response to glucose stimulation (Figure 5G 0 ) shows that cell 1 exhibits glucose-dependent GcAMP6s signal oscillations, as well as a peak upon stimulation with the membrane depolarization agent potassium chloride (KCl). Cell 2, in contrast, does not have a typical response. Thus, while some neogenic insulin-expressing cells display functional b cell-like maturity, other cells are still non-functional at this stage. This experiment was repeated with a third donor (6,578; STAR Methods, demo-\n\ngraphics), a confirmed T1D case. In this instance, we tested the effect of THR-184, a small cyclic peptide with BMP-7-like activity 77,78 used in phase II clinical trials for acute kidney injury. 79,80 In Figure 5H (left) we show three neogenic insulin-expressing cells whose transition from red to blue starts around day 7 (2 days after THR-184 removal). As shown in Figure 5H 0 , in this case, all three cells exhibit glucose concentration-dependent oscillations in GcAMP6s signal consistent with functional insulin release. To classify and quantify the degree of glucose responsiveness, we analyzed the Ca 2+ activity profiles of dozens of extrainsular blue-labeled cells from the last two slice preparations and a third one processed in-house from a 57-year-old male African American donor without diabetes (n = 3 donors). Between the three samples, we analyzed 177 moxBFP + cells in the BMP-7-treated group and 233 in the THR-184-treated group. Depending on the pattern observed, we assigned them to three different categories, namely: (1) cells undergoing a complete cycle of stimulation (3, 20, 3 mM and KCl); (2) cells showing a partial response (unresponsive to KCl-induced depolarization); and (3) cells with irregular activity (i.e., where GcAMP6 intensity does not correlate with glucose concentration). Figures 5I and 5J presents the allocation of cells by category for BMP-7- and THR184-treated slices, respectively (see also Data S6, Ca 2+ responses).\n\nTaken together, our results confirm that BMPR agonists induce the formation of new insulin-producing cells in HPSs, and that at least some of these are glucose responsive within the 10-day time frame of these experiments."
