Here, we use Ribo-seq and RNA-seq to show that genes related to oxidative phosphorylation are translationally downregulated during heart regeneration. We /uniFB01 ndthat Nat10 regulates the expression of Uqcr11 and Uqcrb mRNAs in mouse and human cardiomyocytes. In mice, overexpression of Nat10 in cardiomyocytes promotes cardiac regeneration and improves cardiac function after injury. Conversely, treating neonatal mice with Remodelin -a Nat10 pharmacological inhibitor -or genetically removing Nat10 from their cardiomyocytes both inhibit heart regeneration. Mechanistically, Nat10 suppresses the expression of Uqcr11 and Uqcrb independently of its ac4C enzyme activity. This suppression weakens mitochondrial respiration and enhances the glycolytic capacity of the cardiomyocytes, leading to metabolic reprogramming. We also observe that the expression of Nat10 is downregulated in the cardiomyocytes of P7 male pig hearts compared to P1 controls. The levels of Nat10 are also lower in female human failing hearts than non-failing hearts. Wefurther identify the speci /uniFB01 c binding regions of Nat10, and validate the proproliferative effects of Nat10 in cardiomyocytes derived from human embryonic stem cells. Our /uniFB01 ndings indicate that Nat10 is an epigenetic regulator during heart regeneration and could potentially become a clinical target.\n\nIschemic heart disease (IHD) remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with the loss of cardiomyocytes being the primary contributor to cardiac remodeling and heart failure. Therefore, replenishing the loss of cardiomyocytes is crucial for the prevention and treatment of IHD. Since researchers have discovered that the cardiomyocytes of newborn hearts, as opposed to those of adult mammals, possess the potential to regenerate, stimulating endogenous cardiomyocyte proliferation has emerged as an appealing strategy\n\nfor promoting cardiac regeneration and repair. Some genes and noncoding RNAs have been identi /uniFB01 ed as the regulators of heart repair and regeneration 1 -6 , which helps us gain a much deeper insight into this process. The transition of oxygen-rich environment and the metabolism from glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) after birth are responsible for the cell-cycle arrest of cardiomyocytes 7,8 . Despite this understanding, the regulatory genes and precise mechanisms that govern this metabolic reprogramming process have yet to be fully elucidated. Mitochondrial OXPHOS relates to electron transfer chains containing mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes (MRCC) I-V. Among them, MRCC III is a necessary protein for mitochondrial OXPHOS, and MRCC V is closely related to ATP synthesis. However, the involvement of mitochondrial OXPHOS in regulating cardiomyocyte proliferation is still unclear.\n\nVarious genes regulating cardiomyocyte renewal and heart regeneration have been identi /uniFB01 ed through the analysis of ' omics ' -methods based on a variety of technologies 9 -12 . Despite the prevalence of gene expression pro /uniFB01 le analyses in contemporary research, the emphasis is primarily on transcriptional levels, with limited attention given to translational pro /uniFB01 ling during heart regeneration. Ribo-seq reveals translational regulation by pro /uniFB01 ling the number and position of ribosomes on mRNA through recognizing ribosome protective fragments(RPFs) 13,14 . It has been applied to explore translational regulation in various biological processes 15 -20 . However, translational regulation of cardiac regeneration has not yet been documented. Given that translational regulation is the primary determinant of protein production, a critical aspect of gene expression, it is imperative to investigate translatomic changes during cardiac regeneration to unravel the key regulators. N-Acetyltransferase 10 (Nat10) is a nuclear protein with acetyltransferase activity which is rich in lysine and RNA cytidine. It has been reported that Nat10 regulates the RNA translation and the behaviors of various cancer cells by enriching the ac4C modi /uniFB01 cation of mRNAs 21 -25 . Besides, Nat10 is involved in piRNA-HAAPIR regulation of cardiomyocyte apoptosis by enhancing the ac4C modi /uniFB01 cation of Tfec mRNA 26 . However, the role and underlying mechanism of Nat10 in cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration remains unclear.\n\nHere, we conduct translatomics research on regenerative heart tissue to pro /uniFB01 le the translational landscape and explore the key regulators involved in heart regeneration. Our /uniFB01 ndings indicate that the translation of genes related to OXPHOS is suppressed during cardiac regeneration. The OXPHOS-related genes Uqcr11 and Uqcrb have the function of regulating cardiomyocyte cycling. We also identify Nat10 as a key regulator that non-classically represses the translation of Uqcr11 and Uqcrb independently of ac4C modi /uniFB01 cation, which induces mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming and promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation. We further demonstrate that overexpression of Nat10 in cardiomyocytes enhances cardiomyocyte proliferation and improves heart function after myocardial infarction (MI). Conversely, down-regulation of Nat10 through genetic or inhibitory approaches inhibits cardiomyocyte cycling and heart regeneration after injury in neonatal mice. We further identify the speci /uniFB01 c binding regions of Nat10 to Uqcr11 and Uqcrb mRNAs and reveal transcriptional factor Hes1 as the upstream regulator of Nat10. Collectively, our /uniFB01 ndings suggest Nat10 as a key epigenetic regulator mediating heart regeneration and a promising therapeutic target for enhancing cardiomyocyte cycling and improving heart function after MI.\n",

            "content": "To gain insights into the translational landscape involved in cardiac regeneration, we performed apical resection (AR) on newborn mice to induce cardiac regeneration. The heart tissues in the damaged marginal area were collected for ribosome pro /uniFB01 ling (Ribo-seq) on the 6th day after AR, and transcriptomic changes in the regenerated hearts were revealed by RNA-seq (Fig. 1a). The analysis of Ribo-seq data showed that the majority of ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs) mappedtothecodingsequence(CDS)regionsofgenes,withthefewer fragments found in the 5 \u2032 and 3 \u2032 untranslated regions (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The size distribution of the RPFs was consistent with the expected pattern, with a peak at 28 nucleotides (nt) (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Furthermore, the ribosome footprint positions analysis showedthat RPFs were predominantly located in the /uniFB01 rst reading code frame and exhibited a 3-nt periodicity along the transcript, and ribosomes were evenly distributed throughout the CDS region with good quality (Supplementary Fig. 1c).\n\nUpon analyzing the Ribo-seq data, it was found that the RPF counts of 486 genes manifested alterations. Speci /uniFB01 cally, 258 of these genes underwent up-regulation while 228 were down-regulated (Fold Changes&gt;1.5, P &lt;0.05) (Fig. 1b, c). KEGG analysis of the altered RPFs revealed that extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor interaction pathway was the most signi /uniFB01 cantly enriched, suggesting that the number of ribosomes translating mRNA of ECM-related genes was primarily affected (Fig. 1d). This is consistent with previous studies that uncovered the role of ECM in controlling cardiac repair and regeneration 9,27,28 . Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis showed that 567 transcripts increased while 327 transcripts decreased (Fig. 1e, f). Among these, the up-regulation of Zeb2, known to promote angiogenesis after heart injury 29 , and the down-regulation of Col1, a marker of cardiac /uniFB01 brosis 30 , were observed. KEGG analysis of the transcriptomics revealed the enrichment of MAPK signaling pathway and Rap1 signaling pathway, both associated with cardiac repair (Fig. 1g) 31 -33 .\n\nTo better know the correlation between RPFs and RNA, we analyzed the data from Ribo-seq and RNA-seq analyses and identi /uniFB01 ed8383 genes common to both datasets (Fig. 1h). Among these genes, approximately 93% exhibited no or minimal changes in both transcription and RPF levels (Fig. 1i, j). By contrast, 57 genes showed signi /uniFB01 cant changes both transcriptionally and translationally. Of these, 40 genes changed consistently in both RNA and RPF levels, of which 30 were up-regulated and 10 were down-regulated, while 17 genes changed contradictorily. Besides, 548 genes merely changed in RNA level, while 437 genes changed exclusively in RPF level (Fig. 1i, j). Altogether, it indicates that the majority of cardiac genes exhibit unaltered RNA and RPF levels during heart regeneration, with only some genes being regulated at the either transcriptional or translational level. Furthermore, the changes at the two levels appears to be relatively independent."

TE is important to re /uniFB02 ect the changes in the translatomics landscape, which is associated with RNA quantity and RPF density. Therefore, the data from Ribo-seq and RNA-seq were analyzed to evaluate TE. The results showed that the TE of 328 genes increased, while the TE of 586 genes decreased (Fig. 2a, b). The pathways enriched in RNA and RPF data were also observed in TE analysis (Supplementary Fig. 2a). In addition, ErbB signaling pathway, mTOR signaling pathway, and VEGF signaling pathway were enriched, which have been previously implicated in the regulation of cardiac regeneration 34 -37 .\n\nGiven the relationship between TE and the abundance of RNA and ribosomes on transcripts, TE /uniFB02 uctuations do not completely secure protein /uniFB02 uctuation. Therefore, to identify genes that undergo changes due to translational regulation during cardiac regeneration, we integrated and analyzed RNA, RPF, and TE data. It was revealed that 71 genes changed translationally but not transcriptionally (Fold changes &gt;1.5, P &lt;0.05), including 25 up-regulated genes and 46 down-regulated genes (Fig. 2c). KEGG analysis showed that these genes were closely related to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and protein digestion and absorption (Fig. 2d). Actually, OXPHOS-related genes were down-\n\nregulated and the protein digestion- and absorption-related genes were up-regulated translationally (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 2b). After birth, cells gradually rely on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation as their main metabolic approach, which is related to the loss of heart regeneration ability 7,8 . Thus, we focused on OXPHOS-related\n\ngenes Uqcr11, Uqcrb, and Atp5j2, which were regulated translationally (Fig. 2f).\n\nIn order to validate the sequencing data, the expression of Uqcr11, Uqcrb, and Atp5j2 was detected. We found no discernible variation in mRNA expression levels of these genes between the sham and AR\n\ntissues (Fig. 2g). However, when we measured the protein expression of these genes in the heart tissues of both groups, we observed the down-regulation of Uqcr11, Uqcrb, and Atp5j2 in the AR group compared to the sham group (Fig. 2h). Subsequently, heart tissues of sham and AR mice were collected and subjected to polysome pro /uniFB01 ling analysis to investigate the translational regulation of these genes. Our /uniFB01 ndings revealed that more mRNA of Uqcr11, Uqcrb, and Atp5j2 were enriched in the light polysome fractions, while fewer mRNAs were enriched in the heavy polysome fractions in the AR mice compared to the sham mice (Fig. 2i and Supplementary Fig. 3a). These results show that translational regulation occurs during cardiac regeneration and\n\nthat the translation of OXPHOS-related genes Uqcr11, Uqcrb, and Atp5j2 is down-regulated, indicating that the energy source and metabolic mode may have undergone translational remodeling."

            "content": "To explore the key epigenetic regulators of Uqcr11, Uqcrb, and Atp5j2, we analyzed the genes involved in translational regulation in the RNAseq data (Fig. 3a). Subsequently, we analyzed the interaction between thesegenes and Uqcr11, Uqcrb, and Atp5j2. The top 10 genes were then selected and subjected to qRT-PCR veri /uniFB01 cation (Fig. 3b, c). The results showed that the expression of Nat10, Alkbh5, Ythdf3, Mtor, and Gcn1\n\nchanged in the tissues of AR mice compared with those of sham mice, with Nat10 exhibiting the more signi /uniFB01 cant up-regulation (Fig. 3c). We then detected the effects of Nat10, Alkbh5, Ythdf3, Mtor, and Gcn1 on the expression of Uqcr11, Uqcrb, and Atp5j2 mRNA and discovered that Ythdf3, Mtor, and Gcn1 affected the mRNA expression of Uqcr11, Uqcrb, and Atp5j2, while Nat10 and Alkbh5 did not change their expression (Fig. 3d). This indicates that Ythdf3, Mtor, and Gcn1\n\nregulate the transcription of these genes, while Nat10 and Alkbh5 have noeffect. To explore translational regulators of OXPHOS-related genes during cardiac regeneration, we applied polysome pro /uniFB01 ling analysis and found that Nat10 decreased Uqcr11 and Uqcrb mRNA enrichment in the heavier polysome fractions, shifting their distribution from the heavier to the lighter polysome fractions whereas showed no effect on the distribution of Atp5j2 mRNA (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 3b).\n\nMeanwhile, Alkbh5 had no effect on their translation (Fig. 3e). Western blot results showed that overexpression of Nat10 reduced the protein expression levels of Uqcr11 and Uqcrb, while knockdown of Nat10 enhanced their protein expression levels (Fig. 3f, g and Supplementary Fig. 4). When the protein degradation was inhibited by MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, Nat10 overexpression still could inhibit the Uqcr11 and Uqcrb protein levels (Supplementary Fig. 5). The results described above indicate that Nat10 is the key regulator of the translation of Uqcr11 and Uqcrb. Overexpression of Nat10 inhibits the translation of Uqcr11 and Uqcrb, decreasing their expression; conversely, knockdown of Nat10 increases their expression."

            "subtitle": "## The translation of Uqcr11 and Uqcrb mediating cardiomyocyte proliferation is regulated by Nat10 in an ac4Cindependent manner",
            "content": "Nat10, the only known RNA ac4C modifying enzyme, is pivotal in various processes. To unveil the mechanism of Nat10 regulating gene translation, we applied a predictor 38 of ac4C sites and conducted ac4C RIP to identify the ac4C modi /uniFB01 cation on the mRNA of Uqcr11 and Uqcrb. Unexpected, the predicted and ac4C RIP results showed that there was no ac4C modi /uniFB01 cation on the mRNA of Uqcr11 and Uqcrb (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 6). It suggests that Nat10 probably regulates the expression of Uqcrb and Uqcr11 not through a classic approach of regulating their ac4C modi /uniFB01 cation and translation in ribosomes. Interestingly, Nat10 RIP results revealed that Nat10 could bind to the mRNA of Uqcr11 and Uqcrb directly (Fig. 4b). The mRNA traf /uniFB01 c and localization are associated with translational expression of genes. Our investigation further uncovered that Nat10 affected the RNA localization of Uqcr11 and Uqcrb. Overexpression of Nat10 increased the nuclear distribution of Uqcr11 and Uqcrb mRNAs, and Nat10 knowdown promoted their cytoplasmic distribution (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 7). Moreover, RIP experiment showed that overexpression of Nat10 decreased the abundance of Uqcr11 and Uqcrb mRNAs pulled down by Nxf1 which is the main ' transport vehicle ' for mRNAs (Supplementary Fig. 8). This indicates that Nat10 binds to Uqcr11 and Uqcrb respective transcripts, inhibits their mRNA nuclear export, and reduces the number of their mRNA translated in ribosomes, which exerts its inhibitory effect on Uqcr11 and Uqcrb mRNA translation in a non-classical manner.\n\nAdditionally, to further identify the speci /uniFB01 c binding of Nat10 to Uqcr11 and Uqcrb mRNAs, we predicted the binding sites between Nat10 and Uqcr11 or Uqcrb using the catRAPID algorithm (Supplementary Fig. 9A and B). Then, we constructed the Nat10 plasmids with binding site mutations, as well as Uqcr11 and Uqcrb mRNA mutations with biotin labeled. The RIP experiments implied that the 224-277 and 724-775 amino acid residues of Nat10 were the binding sites for Uqcr11 and Uqcrb mRNAs, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 9c). Nat10\u0394 224277 and Nat10\u0394 724-775 had no inhibitory effect on Uqcr11 and Uqcrb mRNAs ' nuclear export and protein expression, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 9d -f). Moreover, RNA pull-down experiment displayed that wild-type Uqcr11 and Uqcrb mRNAs could pull down Nat10, while the mutants of Uqcr11 and Uqcrb either lost or weakened their interaction with Nat10 (Supplementary Fig. 9g). This indicates that Nat10 binds speci /uniFB01 cally to Uqcr11 and Uqcrb mRNAs.\n\nTo provide further evidence that the regulation of Uqcr11 and UqcrbbyNat10 is not dependent on ac4C modi /uniFB01 cation, we conducted a mutation of the ac4C modi /uniFB01 cation function in Nat10 (Nat10 G641E) according to the literature report 39 (Fig. 4d). Ac4C dot blot hybridization showed that overexpression of Nat10 increased the ac4C modi /uniFB01 cation level of RNA in cardiomyocytes, while the ac4C modi /uniFB01 cation after the mutation of Nat10 was abrogated (Fig. 4e). Meanwhile, Nat10 G641E was also able to increase the expression of Nat10 (Fig. 4f). Furthermore, the polysome pro /uniFB01 ling results showed that, although losing the function of ac4C modi /uniFB01 cation, Nat10 G641E could still inhibit the expression of Uqcr11 and Uqcrb (Fig. 4g and\n\nSupplementary Fig. 10). These results suggest that Nat10 nonclassically reduces the translation of Uqcr11 and Uqcrb in an ac4Cindependent manner.\n\nTo explore the effects of Uqcr11, Uqcrb, and Atp5j2 on cardiomyocyteproliferation and renewal, which were down-regulated during heart regeneration, we detected their effects on the cell cycle of cardiomyocytes. The results showed that the number of EdU, pH3 and Ki67-positive cardiomyocytes did not change after knocking down Atp5j2 (Fig. 4h and Supplementary Fig. 11). However, Uqcrb siRNA signi /uniFB01 cantly increased the number of EdU and Ki67-positive cardiomyocytes, whereas it slightly increased the number of pH3-positive cardiomyocytes (Fig. 4h and Supplementary Fig. 11). Moreover, cardiomyocytes expressing EdU, pH3, and Ki67 were markedly increased after interfering with the expression of Uqcr11 (Fig. 4h and Supplementary Fig. 11). The above results indicate that Uqcr11 and Uqcrb negatively regulated by Nat10 inhibit cardiomyocyte proliferation. However, it is not clear yet whether Nat10 can regulate cardiomyocyte cycling and cardiac regeneration. Therefore, we next investigate the role and mechanism of Nat10 in cardiac regeneration."

            "content": "To further determine the role of Nat10 in heart regeneration, we used western blot to detect the expression of Nat10 in the heart tissue of mice subjected to AR and at different times after birth. The results showed that the expression of Nat10 in the heart tissues was upregulated after AR, while down-regulated after birth (Fig. 5a, b). In order to monitor the expression changes of Nat10 in cardiomyocytes, we isolated cardiomyocytes from cardiac tissues of P1, P7, and adult mice and detected Nat10 expression. The results showed that the protein level of Nat10 in cardiomyocytes declined gradually with the increase in birth time (Fig. 5c). This illustrates that Nat10 has a critical regulatory role in cardiomyocyte cycling and heart regeneration.\n\nThen, the EdU incorporation assay and cellular immuno/uniFB02 uorescence technology were used to detect the regulatory effect of Nat10 on cardiomyocyte proliferation. The results showed that overexpression of Nat10 raised the positive rate of Ki67, EdU, and pH3 in cardiomyocytes (Fig. 5d). On the contrary, interfering with the expression of Nat10 reduced the percentage of Ki67, EdU, and pH3 (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 11). These results indicate that Nat10 could regulate the proliferation of cardiomyocytes. Moreover, we also detected the regulatory effect of Nat10 on HL1 proliferation. Similar to the results obtained from isolated cardiomyocytes from the heart, Nat10 overexpression promoted HL-1 proliferation, while knockdown of Nat10 inhibited HL-1 proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 12). Given that we have proven that Nat10 inhibits the non-classical translation of Uqcr11 and Uqcrb by affecting its distribution, we tested whether the target genes could rescue the regulatory effect of Nat10 on cardiomyocyte cell cycle entry. The outcomes of immuno /uniFB02 uorescence staining showed that the reduction of EdU, Ki67, and pH3 positive cardiomyocytes occurred due to Nat10 knockdown, while the proliferation rate increased when Uqcr11 was knocked down in conjunction with Nat10 silencing in cardiomyocytes (Fig. 5e). Uqcrb could partially reverse the regulatory effect of interfering with Nat10 on the cardiomyocyte cell cycle, while silencing the expression of Uqcrb and Uqcr11 simultaneously blocked the inhibitory in /uniFB02 uence of Nat10 siRNA in cardiomyocyte proliferation to a greater extent (Fig. 5f). The above results indicate that Nat10 regulates cardiomyocyte proliferation by targeting Uqcr11 and Uqcrb, and may play a crucial role in cardiac regeneration and repair.\n\nThe conversion of metabolic mode from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis contributes to the activation of cardiomyocyte proliferation 7 . In the Ribo-seq data of cardiac regeneration, the RPFs and TE of mitochondrial complex components related to oxidative phosphorylation were mainly down-regulated, while the TE\n\nreversed the inhibitory effect of Nat10 siRNA on glycolysis (Fig. 5j). These data indicate that Nat10 affects the metabolism of cardiomyocytes by regulating the expression of Uqcrb and Uqcr11, thus mediating the proliferation of cardiomyocytes."

These data imply that Remodelin attenuates neonatal heart regeneration.\n\nTo further clarify the mechanism of Remodelin in regulating the expression of Uqcr11 and Uqcrb, we overexpressed wild-type Nat10 and Nat10 mutants (Nat10-G641E, Nat10\u0394 224-277 and Nat10\u0394 724-775) in\n\nFig. 5 | Nat10 regulates cardiomyocyte proliferation by targeting Uqcr11 and Uqcrb. a The expression of Nat10 in hearts of sham and AR mice ( n =6 independent mice). ** p &lt;0.01 vs. sham group. b The expression of Nat10 in the heart tissues at different times points after birth ( n =6independentmice).*** p &lt;0.001vs. P1. c The expression of Nat10 in cardiomyocytes isolated from heart tissues at different times points after birth ( n =4 independent experiments from 8 mice per group). ** p &lt;0.01, *** p &lt;0.001 vs. P1. d Immuno /uniFB02 uorescence staining showing the expression of EdU, pH3 and Ki67 in cardiomyocytes with overexpression or knockdownofNat10( n =6independentexperiments).*** p &lt;0.001vs.VectororNC siRNA. e , f The effects of Nat10 knockdown and rescued by Uqcr11/Uqcrb knockdown on cardiomyocyte cell cycle determined by immuno /uniFB02 uorescence staining ( e , n =6 independent experiments; f , n =3 independent experiments). *** p &lt;0.001 vs. NC siRNA, ## p &lt;0.01, ### p &lt;0.001 vs. Nat10 siRNA. White arrows point the region (Supplementary Fig. 18a). To con /uniFB01 rm the regulatory effect of Hes1 on Nat10 in cardiomyocytes, we constructed luciferase reporter vectors containing the full-length promoter of Nat10. The dualluciferase reporter assays revealed that overexpression of Hes1 led to a promotion of Nat10 promoter activity (Supplementary Fig. 18b). Sequential deletions of the Nat10 promoter, according to the presumptive binding sites, uncovered that the deletion of a Nat10 promoter containing fragment of 1500 -1509 resulted in the disappearance of Hes1 overexpression activation of Nat10 transcriptional activity (Supplementary Fig. 18b). Subsequently, we detected the effect of Hes1 on Nat10 expression. The results showed that overexpression of Hes1 promoted, while Hes1 siRNA reduced the expression of Nat10 (Supplementary Fig. 18c). We also observed the expression of Hes1 in P1, P7, and AR hearts. The results showed that Hes1 is decreased in P7 heart compared to P1 heart, while increased in AR hearts compared to sham (Supplementary Fig. 18D and E). These results imply that the expression of Nat10 is regulated by its transcription factor, Hes1."
