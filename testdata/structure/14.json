We inferred their differentiation trajectory and identified three highly proliferative oligopotent progenitor populations downstream of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)/multipotent progenitors (MPPs). Along this trajectory, we observed opposing patterns of chromatin accessibility and differentiation that coincided with dynamic changes in the activity of distinct lineage-specific transcription factors. Integrative analysis of chromatin accessibility and gene expression revealed extensive epigenetic but not transcriptional priming of HSCs/ MPPs prior to their lineage commitment. Finally, we refined and functionally validated the sorting strategy for the HSCs/MPPs and achieved around 90% enrichment. Our study provides a useful framework for future investigation of human developmental hematopoiesis in the context of blood pathologies and regenerative medicine.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nDuring embryonic development, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) need to rapidly differentiate into mature blood cells. Our current knowledge of fetal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) has mainly been advanced by murine and in vitro model systems. It has been demonstrated that fetal hematopoiesis consists of several separate waves of specification, migration, and differentiation of rare HSCs at distinct organs during development (Ivanovs et al., 2017). In humans, definitive hematopoiesis starts with the appearance of HSCs within hematopoietic clusters, in the dorsal aorta, 27 days post-conception. These definitive HSCs first colonize the fetal liver at 4 post-conceptional weeks (pcw), where they expand in numbers. At 10.5 pcw, the hematopoietic site shifts once more to the cavities of bones (i.e., bone marrow [BM]), where adult hematopoiesis is established permanently. The first HSCs that seed the bone marrow are thought to continue to rapidly increase in numbers before undergoing a dramatic change in their proliferative and differentiation properties to accommodate the need for high production of differentiated progeny (Mikkola and Orkin, 2006).\n\nHistorically, differentiation processes in the hematopoietic system have been depicted as a series of intermediate steps, defined by panels of cell surface markers (i.e., cluster of differentiation [CD]). In this model, often represented as a ''hematopoietic tree,'' HSCs give rise to increasingly lineage-restricted cell types, eventually leading to mature blood cells (Akashi et al., 1999; Weissman, 2000). This paradigm has shifted in the last 5 years, with several studies reporting the transcriptomes of thousands of single hematopoietic cells, isolated by cell surface markers, in the mouse model and in adult humans (Paul et al., 2015; Velten et al., 2017). These reports showed that progenitor populations, thought previously to be homogeneous, are actually very heterogeneous on the transcriptional level.\n\nThe mechanisms underlying early fate decisions in HSCs are largely unknown. It has been postulated that the stochastic expression of lineage-specific transcription factors (TFs) above the noise threshold can ''lock'' a cell into a distinct cell fate (Graf and Enver, 2009). In line with this, co-expression of genes associated with antagonistic lineages, including key TFs, have been observed in multipotent hematopoietic cells, albeit at low levels (Hu et al., 1997; Miyamoto et al., 2002). This points toward the presence of sub-populations of cells within the multipotent\n\ncompartment that are permissive for opposing cell fates prior to their lineage commitment, a phenomenon referred to as priming (Nimmo et al., 2015). More recently, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of human HSPCs introduced a different concept of priming. Studies of adult bone marrow and fetal liver hematopoiesis have identified sub-populations of HSCs and multipotent progenitors (MPPs) with coordinated expression of marker genes, specific for distinct unilineage differentiation programs, that gradually increase along all differentiation branches (Velten et al., 2017; Popescu et al., 2019). In addition, there are some indications that lineage priming in the HSC compartment might be happening not only on the transcriptional but also at the epigenetic level (Nimmo et al., 2015). Data from single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq) of phenotypic HSPCs from adult human bone marrow show that phenotypic MPPs have variations in chromatin accessibility consistent with a bias toward erythroid and lymphoid lineages (Buenrostro et al., 2018).\n\nHere we performed an integrative analysis of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq of more than 8,000 immunophenotypic HSPCs from 17-22 pcw human fetal liver, femur, and hip to define transcriptional and epigenetic changes during blood differentiation. Weexplored lineage priming at the transcriptional and chromatin levels in HSCs/MPPs and refined the sorting strategy for isolation of a highly enriched HSC/MPP population.\n",

            "content": "To capture the full repertoire of hematopoietic cells during fetal development, we single-cell-sorted phenotypically defined blood populations from matched (i.e., from the same individual) fetal livers, femora, and hip (iliac) bones between 17 and 22 pcw (Figure 1A). Cells from the liver, hip, and femur were sorted and processed independently in all experiments. Thus, each cell can be traced back to the fetus and organ it came from. We used a hierarchical approach where we first isolated non-committed (Lin /C0 [CD3, CD8, CD11b, CD14, CD19, and CD56] CD34+ CD38 /C0 ) progenitors that contain all immature hematopoietic populations and are present at a frequency of less than 0.1% of the total fetal bone marrow (Golfier et al., 2000), followed by a more restrictive panel to capture differentiated and mature cell types. We next isolated committed (Lin /C0 , CD34+ CD38+) progenitors as well as phenotypic HSCs, MPPs, common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs), granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs), and common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs). In addition, based on broad phenotypic markers, we sorted T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), monocytes, dendritic cells, mast cells, basophils, neutrophils, eosinophils, erythroid progenitors, erythrocytes, immature megakaryocytes (MKs), mature MKs, progenitor B cells (pro-B cells), precursor B cells (pre-B cells), mature B cells, and endothelial cells (Table S1; Figure S1).\n\nbatch effects, we merged the datasets from all samples and tissues using autoencoders (AEs) and applied the batch-balanced k nearest neighbors (BBKNN) approach (Pola /C19 nski et al., 2020; Luecken et al., 2020) to the latent space (Tangherloni et al., 2019; Figure S2O). We applied the graph-based Leiden clustering algorithm (Traag et al., 2019) to the batch-corrected neighborhood graph. Based on differential expression (DE) analysis and the top 20 marker genes (Figure 1B) ranked by significance of standardized expression, we manually annotated 23 distinct populations. Within the hematopoietic progenitor compartment, we annotated clusters as HSCs/MPPs, cycling HSCs/MPPs (HSCs/MPPs-Cycle), lymphoid-myeloid progenitors (LMPs), MK-erythroid-mast progenitors (MEMPs), cycling MEMPs (MEMPs-Cycle), granulocytic progenitors (GPs), as well as numerous mature blood cell types, as shown in the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) space (Becht et al., 2018; Figure 1D).\n\nOf the mature blood cell types, we identified clear transcriptional signatures of erythroid cells (expressing HBG1 , HBA1 , GYPA , and ALAS2 ), MKs (expressing FLI1 , ITGA2B , and GP9 ), monocyte progenitors and monocytes (expressing CD14 , MPEG1 , and CD33 ), CD4+ monocytes, mast cells (expressing CD63 , GATA2 , and HDC ), plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs; expressing IL3RA , IRF8 , MPEG1 , and JCHAIN ) with an additional cluster of highly cycling pDCs (expressing pDC and proliferation markers; e.g., MKI67 ), and granulocytes 1, 2, and 3 (expressing AZU1 , MPO , and PRTN3 ) (Figure 1B; Figure S3). Although granulocytes were present in our dataset, we could not clearly distinguish neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils because of the mixed expression signatures. In the lymphoid compartment, we identified NK cells (expressing CD3D , IL2RB , and CD96 ) and B cells (expressing CD19 and CD79B ) (Figure 1B; Figure S3). The B cell lineage included pro-B cells, which showed expression of IGLL1 and RAG1 , and pre-B cells, expressing high levels of CD79B , VPREB1 , and CD24 (Figure 1B). Finally, we identified a cluster of mature B cells expressing high levels of IGHM and decreased levels of IGLL1 compared with pro/pre-B cell clusters (Figure 1B). We did not detect any T cells or ILCs in the liver or femur despite sorting phenotypic T cells and ILCs using broad cell surface markers for these populations. Unlike B cells, which mature in the BM, T cells derive from lymphoid progenitors that migrate from the BM to the thymus, where they complete their maturation. The development of ILCs is less understood, but there have been suggestions that ILC precursors migrate early from BM into non-hematopoietic tissues; e.g., gut (Cichocki et al., 2019). Because we only sorted BM and not thymus or gut, we might have captured only progenitors but not T cells and ILCs. By using a deep neural network (DNN) (LeCun et al., 2015) and the top 30 marker genes for each cluster, we were able to correctly classify the cells to the prospective clusters with 90.46% accuracy, confirming that our manual annotation of clusters well separated the distinct cell types/ states (STAR Methods; Figure S4A).\n\nIn the last decade, human HSCs and other progenitor populations have been isolated and used in functional assays based on specific sets of cell surface markers. It has been suggested that the fetal hematopoietic progenitor compartment differs substantially from its adult counterpart (Notta et al., 2016). Our approach allowed us to compare the extent to which the phenotypic\n\nidentity of cell populations (as defined by CD markers) matched their transcriptional state (i.e., our manually curated clusters) and, thus, to critically examine use of CD markers in the context of fetal bone marrow hematopoiesis.\n\nSingle-cell analysis revealed substantial transcriptional heterogeneity within all immunophenotypically defined stem and progenitor populations, with some phenotypic progenitor populations (such as HSCs, MPPs, CMPs, GMPs, MEPs, and CLPs)\n\nbeing comprised of more than 10 different transcriptionally defined populations. (Figure 1C; Figure S4B). This observation is in agreement with recent research showing a high level of heterogeneity of the progenitor compartment of human cord blood (Knapp et al., 2018). Our comparative analysis shows that currently used cell-surface markers are a poor predictor of the transcriptional state of human fetal hematopoietic progenitors."

            "subtitle": "## Inference of Differentiation Trajectories during Fetal Hematopoiesis",
            "content": "Next we used a force-directed graph drawing algorithm, ForceAtlas2, to infer the differentiation trajectory of hematopoietic cells during human fetal development (Jacomy et al., 2014). We initialized a ForceAtlas2 layout with partition-based approximate graph abstraction (PAGA) coordinates from our annotated cell types (Wolf et al., 2019). This initialization generated interpretable single-cell embedding that is faithful to the global topology. The obtained global topology revealed HSCs/MPPs at the tip of the trajectory (Figures 2A and 2B; Figure S3). HSCs/ MPPs showed high expression of MLLT3 , a crucial regulator of human HSC maintenance (Calvanese et al., 2019); HLF , a TF involved in preserving quiescence in HSCs (Komorowska et al., 2017); and MEIS1 , a TF involved in limiting oxidative stress in HSCs, which is necessary for quiescence (Unnisa et al., 2012; Wanget al., 2018). Cells in this cluster also expressed high levels of surface markers of HSPCs, such as CD34 (Morisot et al., 2006), SELL (Ivanovs et al., 2017), and PROM1 (de Wynter et al., 1998; Saha et al., 2020; Figures 1B and 2C). Downstream of HSCs/MPPs, we identified three distinct, highly proliferative, oligopotent progenitor populations. We used Scanpy's dpt function to infer progression of the cells through geodesic distance along the graph. Then we used Scanpy's paga\\_path function to show how the gene expression and annotation changes along the three main paths (MEMPs, GPs, and LMPs) present in the abstracted graph (Figure 2C).\n\nMEMPs connected HSCs/MPPs with MKs, erythroid, and mast cells. In line with this, differentially regulated genes in the HSC/MPP transition to MEMPs included MK/erythroid/mast cell lineage-specific genes such as GATA1 , ITGA2B, PLEK , KLF1 , HDC, and MS4A3 (Figures 1B and 2C; Figure S5B) . The presence of MEMPs in our dataset is consistent with studies in mouse models proposing a common trajectory between erythroid, megakaryocytic, and mast cell lineages (Franco et al., 2010). This concept was more recently supported by a study in human fetal liver showing a shared progenitor of MKs, erythroid cells, and mast cells (Popescu et al., 2019). In addition, weidentified a proliferative population of MEMPs-Cycle of which /C24 92% were in G2M/S phase compared with 65% of MEMPs (Figure 2E). The MEMPs-Cycle population further upregulated erythroid-specific genes such as KLF1 , BLVRB , and TFRC compared with MEMPs, suggesting their gradual commitment toward the erythroid lineage (Figure S5C).\n\nGPs connected the HSC/MPP cluster with granulocyte clusters. Cells in this cluster differentially expressed myeloid lineage-specific genes (e.g., AZU1 , LYZ , and MPO ) compared with HSCs/MMPs (Figure 2C; Figure S5D) and were highly cycling, with 73% of cells in G2M/S phase (Figure 2E). Finally, our data pointed toward the existence of a common progenitor population for B cells, monocytes, pDCs, and NK cells, here annotated\n\nas LMPs. Cells in this cluster expressed genes specific to those lineages, including IGLL1 , HMGB2 , and CD79B (lymphoid) (Figure 2C; Figure S3), and upregulated lymphoid genes such as CD81 , IGLL1 , and HMGN2 compared with the HSC/MPP cluster (Figure S5E). Again, this was a highly proliferative population of cells with /C24 89% of cells in G2M/S phase (Figure 2E).\n\nOur findings support previous studies of early lymphoid commitment in human cord blood in vitro and in vivo that identified a shared lineage progenitor between lymphoid, NK, B, and T cells; monocytes; and dendritic cells (Doulatov et al., 2010; Collin et al., 2011). Interestingly, the LMP cluster had higher expression of MPP-related genes such as SPINK2 , CD52 , and SELL compared with MEMPs, suggesting that these progenitors represent a more immature population compared with MEMPs (Figure S5F).\n\nNext we used the Python implementation of single -cell regulatory network inference and clustering (SCENIC) (Aibar et al., 2017; Van de Sande et al., 2020) to identify master regulators and gene-regulatory networks (GRNs) in HSPCs and mature blood cells across differentiation trajectories. We found 162 regulons, some of which some were enriched across many different cell types, often as a part of the particular differentiation branch, and some were cell type specific (Figure 2D). We identified HLF and HOXA9 as main regulons in HSCs/MPPs, whereas GATA1, GATA2, and TAL1 were identified in the MEMP branch of the hematopoietic tree (Figure 2D). FOXO3 was highly specific for erythroid cells and EOMES, OLIG2, and IRF8 for NK cells, monocytes, and pDCs, respectively. Importantly, the regulons confirmed the inferred differentiation trajectory.\n\nTo further explore heterogeneity within the HSC/MPP population, we examined whether HSCs/MPPs simultaneously primed several different lineage-affiliated programs of gene activity. Although HSCs/MPPs sporadically expressed lymphoid, myeloid, or MK-erythroid differentiation genes, we did not observe consistent expression of antagonistic lineage-affiliated genes in individual cells. In addition, after further sub-clustering the HSCs/MPPs, there was no evident consolidation of lineageaffiliated transcriptional programs in any of the sub-populations (Figure S6). Our scRNA-seq data thus do not support recently reported transcriptional lineage priming in the fetal HSC/MPP compartment (Popescu et al., 2019) and suggest that, transcriptionally, our HSC/MPP cluster represents a highly immature population of cells.\n\nDE analysis between HSCs/MPPs-Cycle and HSCs/MPPs revealed upregulation of genes involved in cell cycle regulation ( FOS , PTP4A1 , MCL1 , and PKN2 ) in HSCs/MPPs-Cycle (Figure S5A), confirming that they are indeed a population of cycling stem and multipotent cells. In line with this, cell cycle analysis confirmed that /C24 36% of HSCs/MPPs were cycling compared with /C24 53% of HSCs/MPPs-Cycle (Figure 2E). HSCs/MPPsCycle had increased expression of genes involved in glycolysis, a feature commonly found in proliferating cells (Ito and Suda, 2014; Figure S5G). However, there were no other transcriptional differences between HSCs/MPPs and HSCs/MPPs-Cycle, excluding the presence of transcriptional priming in the HSCs/ MPPs-Cycle cluster.\n\nPrevious research showed that, contrary to adult blood progenitors that are mainly unilineage, fetalliverblood progenitors maintain\n\nmultilineage potential (Notta et al., 2016). Our data are consistent with this observation and point toward the existence of three oligopotent progenitor populations downstream of the HSC/MPP compartments: MEMPs giving rise to erythroid cells, MKs, and mast cells; GPs differentiating into granulocytes; and LMPs generating lymphoid cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells."

            "content": "Detection of low-abundance transcripts, such as TFs, might be difficult in scRNA-seq data because of technical limitations of the approach, leading to false negatives (so-called dropouts). The activity of these TFs can be inferred, however, from\n\nchromatin accessibility, emphasizing the importance of approaches integrating scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. In addition, chromatin accessibility at regulatory regions might precede gene activity and, thus, have predictive value for future transcription of a gene. Therefore, to further investigate the regulatory events in very immature cell populations, we examined the single-cell chromatin accessibility landscape (using scATAC-seq) of human fetal Lin /C0 CD34+ CD38 /C0 cells (STAR Methods). We sequenced 4,001 cells from liver and femur of three fetuses, 18, 20, and 21 pcw (STAR Methods). Based on our scRNA-seq data, we expected that 90% of captured cells would be associated with one of the six populations: HSCs/MPPs, HSCs/MPPsCycle, MEMPs, MEMPs-Cycle, GPs, and LMPs, with HSCs/ MPPs(Cycle) constituting the majority (Figure S4B).\n\nTo capture peaks that are present in less abundant cell types, such as MEMPs, MEMPs-Cycle, GPs, and LMPs, we employed an iterative peak-calling approach. We first defined open chromatin regions by pooling all data and calling peaks in the pooled samples. Following dimensionality reduction with diffusion maps (Haghverdi et al., 2015) and clustering using the Louvain community detection algorithm (Blondel et al., 2008), we performed a second round of peak calling in clusters with more than 50 cells. Of the initial /C24 474,000 reads, after preprocessing steps (Figures S2D-S2F), on average, we detected /C24 32,400 fragments per cell, and 56% of those mapped to peaks (Figures S2G, S2H, and S2M). Following filtering steps (Figures S2I, S2J, and S2N), 3,611 cells passed QC with 152,282 distinct peaks."

            "subtitle": "## Motif Accessibility Dynamics along the Inferred Differentiation Trajectories",
            "content": "To merge samples and remove the batch effects, we applied Harmony (Korsunsky et al., 2019; Luecken et al., 2020) to the first 50 latent semantic indexing (LSI) components, excluding the first one because it was highly correlated with sequencing depth (Figures S2P and S2Q). By using a shared nearest neighbor (SNN) modularity optimization-based clustering algorithm, we obtained seven distinct clusters of differentially accessible peaks (Figure 3A).\n\nTo explore the chromatin accessibility profiles across the seven clusters, we examined the accessibility of selected marker genes from our scRNA-seq data (Figure 3B). We observed higher accessibility of marker genes associated with stem cells (e.g., MLLT3 , PROM1 , FLI1 , and GATA2 ) and lower accessibility of genes associated with distinct lineages (e.g., MPO , ALAS2 , MPEG1 , and CD19 ), keeping in line with the undifferentiated nature of sorted cells (Figure 3B). Interestingly, we observed clear separation of clusters in terms of their overall accessibility of marker genes, with clusters 1, 2, 4, and 7 being more accessible and clusters 3 and 5 being less accessible. Cluster 6 had a mixed signature (Figure 3B).\n\nExtensively open chromatin in multipotent cells has been associated previously with a permissive state to which multiple programs of gene regulation may be applied upon differentiation and is considered important for maintenance of pluripotency (Gaspar-Maia et al., 2011). To further investigate whether there were global dynamic changes in accessibility patterns associated with differentiation of fetal HSCs/MPPs, we inferred differentiation pseudotime from our scATAC-seq data using the same approach as with scRNA-seq described above. Briefly, we built a force-directed graph from our seven scATAC-seq clusters by initializing a ForceAtlas2 layout with PAGA coordinates (Figures 3C and 3D). The generated trajectory revealed two branches with a clear trend between chromatin accessibility and differentiation in each branch (Figures 3D and 3E). We observed the highest accessibility in clusters 1, 2, and 4, which decreased gradually toward the tips of the two branches (i.e., clusters 1, 2, and 3 on one side and 1, 4, 5, and 6 and 1 and 6 on the other; Figure 3E). This result is compatible with the notion that clusters 1, 2, and 4 represent an HSC/MPP population.\n\nGATA1 activity (Figures 3G and 3H) and gene body accessibility (Figure 3B) were enriched in cluster 6. GATA1 is known to be an important regulator of erythroid, megakaryocytic, and mast cells differentiation (Katsumura et al., 2017) and was expressed exclusively in the MEMP cluster in our scRNA-seq dataset. Thus, the identified trajectories between clusters 1 and 6 and clusters 1, 4, 5, and 6 most likely represent the MEMP differentiation paths (Figure 3D). Interestingly, in cluster 6, compared with clusters 2 and 3, we detected opposing patterns of motif accessibility for the two different TAL1 binding sites (TAL1.0.A and TAL1.1.A, respectively) (Figures 3F-3H). Substantial changes in occupancy by TAL1 during differentiation have been observed that are dependent on its binding partners (Wu et al., 2014). It has been reported previously that TAL1.0.A is co-occupied by TAL1 and GATA1 (Kassouf et al., 2010) and TAL1.1.A by TAL1 and TCF3 (Hsu et al., 1994). Our analysis revealed that the two different TAL1 binding motifs are active in distinct hematopoietic progenitor populations during fetal hematopoiesis (Figures 3F-3H).\n\nClusters 2 and 3 also showed increased activity of CEBPD and IRF8, crucial for myeloid and dendritic cell differentiation, and of\n\nID4 and HTF4, involved in establishment of the lymphoid lineage (Miyazaki et al., 2017; Figures 3F-3H). This points toward clusters 1, 2, and 3 forming a common initial trajectory between the myeloid and lymphoid fate, consistent with our observations in scRNA-seq data. Clusters 1 and 4 were characterized by a high level of activity of TFs of the nuclear factor k B (NFk B) pathway (i.e., NFk B2, REL , and RELB) (Figures 3I-3K) , known to be involved in regulation of HSC maintenance and selfrenewal (Zhao et al., 2012; Esp\u0131 \u00b4n-Palazo \u00b4 n and Traver, 2016)."

            "content": "Next we wanted to map the cells from our scATAC-seq data to specific cell types. Because currently no chromatin accessibility maps are available for human fetal HSPCs, we chose a strategy to integrate our scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq by mapping cells based on their gene body accessibility. We used a recently developed method that identifies pairwise correspondences (called ''anchors'') between single cells across two different types of datasets and their transformation into the shared space (Stuart et al., 2019). This approach allowed us to transfer scRNAseq-derived annotations, learned by a classifier, onto scATACseq data (STAR Methods).\n\nWe trained the classifier on CD34+ CD38 /C0 cells from the scRNA-seq experiment using the six most abundant cell types (STAR Methods). Overall, /C24 57% of scATAC-seq cells were assigned to the HSC/MPP cluster, /C24 18% to HSCs/MPPs-Cycle, /C24 5% to MEMPs, /C24 7% to MEMPs-Cycle, /C24 7% to GPs, and /C24 3% to LMPs. Cells with a prediction score lower than 40% were labeled as unclassified ( /C24 5%) (Figure 4A).\n\nThe frequencies of assigned cell types in the scATAC-seq dataset were highly concordant with the ones from scRNA-seq data (Figure S4B), suggesting that, overall, the two modalities (i.e., chromatin accessibility and transcriptome) are correlated. To validate the cell type assignment of scATAC-seq cells, we examined the accessibility of selected lineage-specific TF motifs in each of the annotated cell types (Figure 4B). In line with the predicted annotations, the GATA1 motif showed the highest accessibility in MEMPs and MEMPs-Cycle, whereas TEF2 (known to play a role in myeloid and lymphoid differentiation; Miyamoto et al., 2002) was most active in GPs and LMPs. Confirming our earlier observation, two distinct TAL1 motifs had anticorrelated accessibility. TAL1.0.A was preferentially active in MEMPs and MEMPs-Cycle and TAL1.1.A in GPs and LMPs (Figure 4B).\n\nThe Force Atlas representation of the classified scATAC-seq cells revealed, however, considerable intermixing of different cell types across the trajectory, with enrichment of MEMPs/ MEMPs-Cycle in cluster 6 and, to a lesser extent, of GPs and LMPs in clusters 2 and 3 (Figure 4C). HSCs/MPPs(-Cycle) were distributed across all seven clusters. This wide distribution of HSCs/MPPs(-Cycle) across multiple clusters within scATACseq data suggested that, even though chromatin accessibility and the transcriptional state of fetal HSCs/MPPs are correlated, there is extensive chromatin priming in the HSC/MPP population that results in their heterogeneity.\n\nNext, we compared the accessibility of selected lineage-specific TF motifs in HSCs/MPPs across the seven clusters (Figures 4D-4G). We observed a low level of activity of all examined TFs in cluster 1, followed by a statistically significant increase of HTF4,\n\nID4, and TFE2 and decrease of GATA1 in HSCs/MPPs in clusters 2 and 3. GATA1 activity, however, increased in HSCs/MPPs in cluster 6. Our data suggest that, within the transcriptionally homogeneous population of HSCs/MPPs, there are significant differences in the activity of specific TFs that may precede gene expression and mark initial priming of HSCs/MPPs prior to their commitment to the specific lineage. To further explore this ''time lag'' between chromatin accessibility and gene expression during differentiation, we examined scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data for the top GATA1-regulon target genes (ranked based on the AUCell score) identified by pySCENIC (Figure 5). We looked at the accessibility of both gene promoters (\u00b13 kb from the transcriptional start site [TSS]) and distal regulatory regions (\u00b150 kb from the TSS) as well as the expression levels of the selected target genes along the MEMP differentiation trajectory (Figure 5A). We observed that promoters of GATA1-regulon target genes were often open in HSCs/MPPs prior to any noticeable gene expression (Figure 5A). Thus, in line with our previous observation, chromatin accessibility in HSCs/MPPs preceded transcriptional changes that were only present in more differentiated cells. Interestingly, promoter accessibility of GATA1 target genes was overall lower in cluster 6 (MEMPs) compared with cluster 1 (HSCs/MPPs) (Figures 5B, 5D, and 5E) and coincided with lower promoter co-accessibility of the antagonistic genes (i.e., genes that are specific for distinct lineages) (Figure 5F). In contrast, the accessibility of distal regulatory elements/enhancers was higher in cluster 6 compared with cluster 1 (Figure 5C). This may indicate that GATA-regulon genes may be primed at promoters, whereas the enhancers contribute celltype-specific expression."

The scRNA-seq analysis of cells sorted with the refined panel showed that /C24 88% of CD-REF cells labeled HSCs/MPPs and HSCs/MPPs-Cycle clusters combined (Figure 6B) compared with commonly used CD panels for HSCs (Lin /C0 CD34+ CD38 /C0 CD45RA /C0 CD90+ CD49f+) and MPPs (Lin /C0 CD34+ CD38 /C0 CD90 /C0 CD45RA /C0 CD49f /C0 CD10 /C0 CD7 /C0 ), where /C24 59% and /C24 73%, respectively, of sorted cells had a transcriptional signature of our most immature cell population (Figure 1C; Figure S4B).\n\nTo assess the differentiation potential and robustness of the lineage output of CD-REF cells, we sorted individual cells from three fetuses on a mouse MS5 feeder layer or on more physiologically relevant, primary human fetal mesenchymal stem cells (fMSCs) (Figure 6C; STAR Methods). After 2 weeks, 80% of cells sorted on MS5 and 85% of cells sorted on human fMSCs\n\ngenerated colonies. In total, we analyzed 201 colonies for their size and lineage output (erythroid [Ery], myeloid [My], MK, and lymphoid [Ly]) using FACS (STAR Methods; Figure S7A). Our FACS analysis revealed that 7% of colonies on MS5 and 8% on fMSCs were quadri-lineage, 43% and 31% were tri-lineage, 29% and 25% were bilineage, 20% and 28% were unilineage, and 1% and 8% were undifferentiated colonies (Figure 6D).\n\nNext we sorted individual CD-REFs and immunophenotypic HSCs (CD34+CD34 /C0 CD90+CD45RA /C0 CD49f+/ /C0 ) from the bone marrow and liver of the same fetus (n = 2) on an MS5 feeder layer and assessed 324 cells in total for their lineage output. Our analysis showed that liver- and femur-derived CD-REF cells had comparable efficacy of colony formation and lineage output, suggesting that CD-REF enriches for the population of cells\n\nwith multilineage output in fetal liver and bone marrow. Similarly, the lineage output of CD-REF cells and immunophenotypic HSCs was comparable; however, the efficacy of colony formation appeared to be higher in CD-REF versus phenotypic HSCs isolated from the femur (Figure S7). Our finding that CD-REF cells indeed have multipotent potential and lineage output comparable with phenotypic HSCs is in line with our observation that these cells sit at the tip of the differentiation trajectories. We computationally and functionally confirmed that CD-REF represents a highly enriched population of HSC/MPPs."

            "content": "Cells in the HSC/MPP cluster originated from the liver, femur, and hip. This provided a unique opportunity to assess potential qualitative and quantitative differences in the HSC/MPP\n\npopulation that originated from fetal liver or bone marrow. We first applied Fisher's exact test to the number of liver and femur cells in the different cell cycle states to determine whether there are non-random associations between the cycle state and the organ of origin (see STAR Methods for further details). Interestingly, there was a statistically significant difference (p = 4.25 3 10 /C0 9 ) in the cell cycle state of cells in the HSC/MPP cluster between femur and liver (Figure 7A). Cells in the femur were predominantly in G1 ( /C24 70% of cells) compared with the same population in the liver ( /C24 52%) (Figure 7B). These data suggest that HSCs/MPPs become more quiescent as they migrate from the liver to the bone marrow during the second trimester of human development. In line with this, HSCs/MPPs were significantly less frequent in the femur compared with the liver (Figure 7D), as confirmed by Fisher's exact test on the total number of liver and femur cells (Figure 7E). This is in agreement with the increased proportion of phenotypic non-committed progenitors (CD34+ CD38 /C0 ) found in the liver compared with the bone marrow (Figure 7C). Using Mki67 and DAPI staining, we quantified the proportion of cells in different stages of the cell cycle-G0 (Mki67 /C0 DAPI /C0 ), G1 (Mki67+DAPI /C0 ), and S-G2-M (Mki67+DAPI+)-as described previously (Kim and Sederstrom, 2015). Our analysis showed that the CD34+CD38 /C0 population is less cycling in the fetal liver and femur compared with the CD34+CD38+ population (Figures 6E and 6F). We further showed that the vast majority of CD-REF cells are in G0/G1 in the femur and liver but that nearly twice as many cells are in S-G2-M in the liver compared with the femur (Figure 6G).\n\nTo evaluate whether there is a statistically significant difference in the number of expressed genes between HSCs/MPPs collected from the liver and femur, we used the KolmogorovSmirnov (KS) and Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (MWW) test. We applied a subsampling strategy to downsample the cluster with more cells and balance the two distributions (STAR Methods). KS and MWW tests revealed a statistically significant decrease in the number of expressed genes in HSCs/MPPs in the femur compared with the liver (Figures 7F and 7G). Gene set enrichment analysis, using pathway databases, of differentially expressed genes between the liver and femur revealed that HSCs/MPPs in the femur upregulate genes involved in nucleosome assembly, chromatin assembly, and DNA packaging, such as HIST1H1E and HIST1H2BN , possibly marking their entry into quiescence (Figure 7H). Interestingly, DE analysis of genes that encode membrane proteins revealed statistically significant upregulation of genes related to actin cytoskeleton remodeling, cell adhesion, and migration (e.g., JAML , SELPLG , LCP1 , MSN , and RHOA ) in HSCs/MPPs in the liver compared with the femur (Figure 7I). This would be in line with the higher propensity of liver HSCs/MPPs to migrate to other tissues, such as bone marrow. In addition, we detected higher expression of interferon-induced gene IFITM1 in fetal liver, known to play a role in transduction of antiproliferative and adhesion sig- nals (Figure 7J). This shift of HSCs/MPPs from highly proliferative to quiescent as well as downregulation of genes involved in actin cytoskeleton remodeling as they migrate from fetal liver to bone marrow signifies the role of the niche in modulation of HSC/MPP behavior."
